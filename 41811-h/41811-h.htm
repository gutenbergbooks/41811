<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the chapter of English history
fullest of romantic interest, is that containing
the life of Thomas à Becket. In fact,
the great struggle between Becket and
Henry II.,&mdash;between individual genius and
sovereign power, between a subject and
his king, between religion and the sword,
between the Church and the State, is
scarcely equaled in the annals of the
world. And nowhere do we find a parallel
to the strange story of Becket's life,
beginning in Oriental legend, ending in
heroic tragedy. By an accident of position,
he questioned with the terrible power
of genius the divine right of kings, and
the grateful people of England, a hundred
thousand at a time, flocked as pilgrims to
his tomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
The biography here presented has been
taken from Dean Milman's great history
of Latin Christianity. The style is at
once dignified, terse, and eloquent. The
learning of Milman is abundant and accurate,
his judgment singularly sound and
free from prejudice. One of the gems of
his history is this life of Becket. A biography
of the biographer is part of our
plan, and we gladly transfer to our pages,
from the English Cyclopedia, a sketch of
Milman's life.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Rev. <span class="smcap">Henry Hart Milman, D.D.</span>,
Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, was born
February 10th, 1791, in London. He is
the youngest son of Sir Francis Milman,
first baronet, who was physician to George
III., and is brother to Sir William George
Milman. He was educated at Dr. Burney's
academy at Greenwich, at Eton
College, and at Brazenose College, Oxford,
where he took his degrees of B. A. and
M. A., and of which he was elected a Fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
In 1812 he received the Newdegate
prize for his English poem on the Apollo
Belvidere. In 1815 he published "Fazio,
a Tragedy," which was performed with
success at Covent Garden Theatre, at a
period when theatrical managers seized
upon a published play, and produced it
without an author's consent. Mr. Milman
could not even enforce the proper pronunciation
of the name of "Fazio." He took
holy orders in 1817, and was appointed
vicar of St. Mary's, Reading. In the early
part of 1818 he published "Samor, Lord
of the Bright City, an Heroic Poem," of
which a second edition was called for in
the course of the same year. The hero
of this poem is a personage of the legendary
history of Britain in the early part
of the Saxon invasions of England. The
fullest account of his exploits is given in
Dugdale's "Baronage," under his title of
Earl of Gloucester. Harrison, in the "Description
of Britain," prefixed to Holinshed's
"Chronicle," calls him Eldulph de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Samor. The Bright City is Gloucester,
(Caer Gloew in British.) In 1820 Mr
Milman published "The Fall of Jerusalem,"
a dramatic poem founded on Josephus's
narrative of the siege of the sacred city.
This, in some respects his most beautiful
poem, established his reputation. In 1821,
he was elected Professor of Poetry in the
University of Oxford, and published three
other dramatic poems, "The Martyr of
Antioch," "Balshazzar," and "Anne Boleyn."
In 1827 he published sermons at
the "Bampton Lecture," 8vo., and in
1829, without his name, "The History
of the Jews," 3 vols. 18vo. A collected
edition of his "Poetical Works," was published
in 1840, which, besides the works
above mentioned, and his smaller poems,
contains the "Nala and Damayanti,"
translated from the Sanskrit. In the
same year he published his "History of
Christianity from the Birth of Christ, to
the Abolition of Paganism in the Roman
Empire," 3 vols. 8vo., in which he professes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
to view Christianity as a historian,
in its moral, social, and political influences,
referring to its doctrines no further than
is necessary for explaining the general
effect of the system. It is the work of an
accomplished and liberal-minded scholar.
At the commencement of 1849 appeared
"The Works of Quintus Horatius Flaccus,
illustrated chiefly from the Remains
of Ancient Art, with a Life by the Rev.
H. H. Milman," 8vo., a beautiful and luxurious
edition. Mr. Milman's Life of Horace,
and critical remarks on the merits
of the Roman poet, are written with much
elegance of style, and are very interesting.</p>

<p>In November 1849, Mr. Milman, who had
for some years been Rector of St. Margaret's,
Westminster, and a Canon of Westminster,
was made Dean of St. Paul's.
Dean Milman's latest publication is a "History
of Latin Christianity, including that
of the Popes to the Pontificate of Nicholas
V.," 3 vols. 8vo. 1854. This work is a
continuation of the author's "History of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Christianity," and yet is in itself a complete
work. To give it that completeness he has
gone over the history of Christianity in
Rome during the first four centuries. The
author states that he is occupied with the
continuation of the history down to the
close of the pontificate of Nicholas V.,
that is, to <span class="locked">1455.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> Besides the works before
mentioned, Dean Milman is understood to
have contributed numerous articles to the
"Quarterly Review;" and his edition of
Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire," presented the great historian
with more ample illustrations than he had
before received. This edition has been republished,
with additional notes and verifications,
by Dr. W. Smith.</p>

<p>Dean Milman is destined to become a
household word in historical literature,
and we are glad to present the many with
this favorable specimen of his work.</p>

<h2 class="p4" id="LIFE_OF" >LIFE OF THOMAS À BECKET.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">Legend.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Popular</span> poetry, after the sanctification
of Becket, delighted in throwing
the rich colors of marvel over his birth
and parentage. It invented, or
rather interwove with the pedigree of
the martyr, one of those romantic traditions
which grew out of the wild adventures
of the crusades, and which occur
in various forms in the ballads of
all nations. That so great a saint should
be the son of a gallant champion of the
cross, and of a Saracen princess, was a
fiction too attractive not to win general
acceptance. The father of Becket, so
runs the legend, a gallant soldier, was
a captive in the Holy Land, and inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the daughter of his master with
an ardent attachment. Through her
means he made his escape; but the enamored
princess could not endure life
without him. She too fled and made
her way to Europe. She had learned
but two words of the Christian language,
London and Gilbert. With
these two magic sounds upon her lips
she reached London; and as she wandered
through the streets, constantly
repeating the name of Gilbert, she was
met by Becket's faithful servant. Becket,
as a good Christian, seems to have
entertained religious scruples as to the
propriety of wedding the faithful, but
misbelieving, or, it might be, not sincerely
believing maiden. The case was
submitted to the highest authority, and
argued before the Bishop of London.
The issue was the baptism of the princess,
by the name of Matilda (that of
the empress queen,) and their marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in St. Paul's, with the utmost publicity
and splendor.</p>

<p>But of this wondrous tale, not one
word had reached the ears of any of the
seven or eight contemporary biographers
of Becket, most of them his most
intimate friends or his most faithful <span class="locked">attendants.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
It was neither known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
John of Salisbury, his confidential adviser
and correspondent, nor to Fitz-Stephen,
an officer of his court in chancery,
and dean of his chapel when archbishop,
who was with him at Northampton,
and at his death; nor to Herbert
de Bosham, likewise one of his officers
when chancellor, and his faithful
attendant throughout his exile; nor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the monk of Pontigny, who waited upon
him and enjoyed his most intimate confidence
during his retreat in that convent;
nor to Edward Grim, his standard-bearer,
who on his way from Clarendon,
reproached him with his weakness, and
having been constantly attached to his
person, finally interposed his arm between
his master and the first blow of
the assassin. Nor were these ardent
admirers of Becket silent from any severe
aversion to the marvelous; they
relate, with unsuspecting faith, dreams
and prognostics which revealed to the
mother the future greatness of her son,
even his elevation to the see of <span class="locked">Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
To the Saxon descent of Becket, a
theory in which, on the authority of an
eloquent French <span class="locked">writer,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> modern history
has seemed disposed to acquiesce,
these biographers not merely give no
support, but furnish direct contradiction.
The lower people no doubt admired
during his life, and worshiped
after death, the blessed Thomas of Canterbury,
and the people were mostly
Saxon. But it was not as a Saxon, but
as a Saint, that Becket was the object
of unbounded popularity during his
life, of idolatry after his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parentage and education.</div>

<p>The father of Becket, according to
the distinct words of one contemporary
biographer, was a
native of Rouen, his mother of <span class="locked">Caen.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Gilbert was no knight-errant, but a
sober merchant, tempted by commercial
advantages to settle in London: his
mother neither boasted of royal Saracenic
blood, nor bore the royal name
of Matilda: she was the daughter of an
honest burgher of Caen. His Norman
descent is still further confirmed by his
claim of relationship, or connexion at
least, as of common Norman descent,
with Archbishop <span class="locked">Theobald.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> The parents
of Becket, he asserts himself, were
merchants of unimpeached character,
not of the lowest class. Gilbert Becket
is said to have served the honorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
office of sheriff, but his fortune
was injured by fires and other
<span class="locked">casualties.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Born <span class="smcap small locked">A. D.</span> 1118.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The young Becket received
his earliest education among the monks
of Merton in Surrey, towards whom he
cherished a fond attachment, and delighted
to visit them in the days of his
splendor. The dwelling of a respectable
London merchant seems to have
been a place where strangers of very
different pursuits, who resorted to the
metropolis of England, took up their
lodging: and to Gilbert Becket's house
came persons both disposed and qualified
to cultivate in various ways the
extraordinary talents displayed by the
youth, who was singularly handsome,
and of engaging <span class="locked">manners.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> A knight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
whose name, Richard de Aquila, occurs
with distinction in the annals of the
time, one of his father's guests, delighted
in initiating the gay and spirited
boy in chivalrous exercises, and in the
chase with hawk and hound. On a
hawking adventure the young Becket
narrowly escaped being drowned in the
Thames. At the same time, or soon
after, he was inured to business by acting
as clerk to a wealthy relative, Osborn
Octuomini, and in the office of the
Sheriff of <span class="locked">London.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> His accomplishments
were completed by a short residence
in Paris, the best school for the
language spoken by the Norman nobility.
To his father's house came likewise
two learned civilians from Bologna,
no doubt on some mission to the Archbishop
of Canterbury. They were so
captivated by young Becket, that they
strongly recommended him to Archbishop
Theobald, whom the father of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Becket reminded of their common honorable
descent from a knightly family
near the town of <span class="locked">Thiersy.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> Becket was
at once on the high road of advancement.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>In the household of the Archbishop.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> His extraordinary abilities
were cultivated by the
wise patronage, and employed
in the service of the primate. Once he
accompanied that prelate to <span class="locked">Rome;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>
and on more than one other occasion
visited that great centre of Christian
affairs. He was permitted to reside for
a certain time at each of the great
schools for the study of the canon law,
Bologna and <span class="locked">Auxerre.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> He was not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
however, without enemies. Even in
the court of Theobald began the jealous
rivalry with Roger, afterwards Archbishop
of York, then Archdeacon of
<span class="locked">Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> Twice the superior influence
of the archdeacon obtained his dismissal
from the service of Theobald;
twice he was reinstated by the good
offices of Walter, Bishop of Rochester.
At length the elevation of Roger to the
see of York left the field open to Becket.
He was appointed to the vacant
archdeaconry, the richest benefice, after
the bishoprics, in England. From that
time he ruled without rival in the favor
of the aged Theobald. Preferments
were heaped upon him by the lavish
bounty of his <span class="locked">patron.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> During his exile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
he was reproached with his ingratitude
to the king, who had raised him from
poverty. "Poverty!" he rejoined;
"even then I held the archdeaconry of
Canterbury, the provostship of Beverley,
a great many churches, and several
<span class="locked">prebends."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> The trial and the triumph
of Becket's precocious abilities was a
negotiation of the utmost difficulty
with the court of Rome. The first object
was to obtain the legatine power
for Archbishop Theobald; the second
tended, more than almost all measures,
to secure the throne of England to the
house of Plantagenet. Archbishop
Theobald, with his clergy, had inclined
to the cause of Matilda and her son;
they had refused to officiate at the coronation
of Eustace, son of King Stephen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Becket not merely obtained from Eugenius
III. the full papal approbation
of this refusal, but a condemnation of
Stephen (whose title had before been
sanctioned by Eugenius himself,) as a
perjured <span class="locked">usurper.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Accession of
Henry II.
Dec. 19, 1154.</div>

<p>But on the accession of Henry II., the
aged Archbishop began to tremble at
his own work; serious apprehensions
arose as to the disposition of
the young king towards the
Church. His connexion was but remote
with the imperial family (though
his mother had worn the imperial
crown, and some imperial blood might
flow in his veins); but the Empire was
still the implacable adversary of the
papal power. Even from his father he
might have received an hereditary
taint of hatred to the Church, for the
Count of Anjou had on many occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
shown the utmost hostility to the Hierarchy,
and had not scrupled to treat
churchmen of the highest rank with unexampled
cruelty. In proportion as it
was important to retain a young sovereign
of such vast dominions in allegiance
to the Church, so was it alarming
to look forward to his disobedience.
The Archbishop was anxious to place
near his person some one who might
counteract this suspected perversity,
and to prevent his young mind from
being alienated from the clergy by
fierce and lawless counselors. He had
discerned not merely unrivaled abilities,
but with prophetic sagacity, his Archdeacon's
lofty and devoted churchmanship.
Through the recommendation of
the primate, Becket was raised to the
dignity of <span class="locked">chancellor,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> an office which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
made him the second civil power in the
realm, inasmuch as his seal was necessary
to countersign all royal mandates.
Nor was it without great ecclesiastical
influence, as in the chancellor was the
appointment of all the royal chaplains,
and the custody of vacant bishoprics,
abbacies, and <span class="locked">benefices.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket

<p>But the Chancellor, who was yet,
with all his great preferments,
only in deacon's orders, might
seem disdainfully to throw aside the
habits, feelings, restraints of the churchman,
and to aspire as to the plenitude
of secular power, so to unprecedented
secular <span class="locked">magnificence.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> Becket shone
out in all the graces of an accomplished
courtier, in the bearing and valor of
a gallant knight; though at the same
time he displayed the most consummate
abilities for business, the promptitude,
diligence, and prudence of a practiced
statesman. The beauty of his person,
the affability of his manners, the extraordinary
acuteness of his <span class="locked">senses,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>activity
in all chivalrous exercises, made
him the chosen companion of the king
in his constant diversions, in the chase
and in the mimic war, in all but his
debaucheries. The king would willingly
have lured the Chancellor into this
companionship likewise; but the silence
of his bitterest enemies, in confirmation
of his own solemn protestations, may be
admitted as conclusive testimonies to
his unimpeached <span class="locked">morals.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> The power
of Becket throughout the king's dominions
equaled that of the king himself&mdash;he
was king in all but name: the
world, it was said, had never seen two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
friends so entirely of one <span class="locked">mind.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> The
well-known anecdote best illustrates
their intimate familiarity. As they
rode through the streets of London on
a bleak Winter day they met a beggar
in rags. "Would it not be charity,"
said the king, "to give that fellow a
cloak, and cover him from the cold?"
Becket assented; on which the king
plucked the rich furred mantle from the
shoulders of the struggling Chancellor
and threw it, to the amazement and admiration
of the bystanders, no doubt to
the secret envy of the courtiers at this
proof of Becket's favor, to the shivering
<span class="locked">beggar.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span></p>

<p>But it was in the graver affairs of
the realm that Henry derived still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
greater advantage from the wisdom and
the conduct of the <span class="locked">Chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> To
Becket's counsels his admiring biographers
attribute the pacification of the
kingdom, the expulsion of the foreign
mercenaries who during the civil wars
of Stephen's reign had devastated the
land and had settled down as conquerors,
especially in Kent, the humiliation
of the refractory barons and the demolition
of their castles. The peace was
so profound that merchants could travel
everywhere in safety, and even the
Jews collect their <span class="locked">debts.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> The magnificence
of Becket redounded to the glory
of his sovereign. In his ordinary life
he was sumptuous beyond precedent;
he kept an open table, where those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
were not so fortunate as to secure a
seat at the board had clean rushes
strewn on the floor, on which they
might repose, eat, and carouse at the
Chancellor's expense. His household
was on a scale vast even for that age
of unbounded retainership, and the
haughtiest Norman nobles were proud
to see their sons brought up in the
family of the merchant's son.

he outshone himself, yet might
seem to have a loyal rather than a personal
aim in this unrivaled pomp. The
French crowded from all quarters to
see the splendid procession pass, and
exclaimed, "What must be the king,
whose Chancellor can indulge in such
enormous expenditure?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">War in
Toulouse.</div>

<p>Even in war the Chancellor had displayed
not only the abilities of a general,
but a personal prowess, which,
though it found many precedents in
those times, might appear somewhat
incongruous in an ecclesiastic, who yet
held all his clerical benefices.
In the expedition made by King Henry
to assert his right to the dominions
of the Counts of Toulouse, Becket
appeared at the head of seven hundred
knights who did him service, and foremost
in every adventurous exploit was
the valiant Chancellor. Becket's bold
counsel urged the immediate storming
of the city, which would have been
followed by the captivity of the King
of France. Henry, in whose character
impetuosity was strangely molded up
with irresolution, dared not risk this
violation of feudal allegiance, the captivity
of his suzerain. The event of the
war showed the policy as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
superior military judgment of the warlike
Chancellor. At a period somewhat
later, Becket, who was left to reduce
certain castles which held out against
his master, unhorsed in single combat
and took prisoner a knight of great distinction,
Engelran de Trie. He returned
to Henry in Normandy at the head
of 1200 knights and 4000 stipendiary
horsemen, raised and maintained at his
own charge. If indeed there were
grave churchmen even in those days
who were revolted by these achievements
in an ecclesiastic (he was still
only in deacon's orders), the sentiment
was by no means universal, nor even
dominant. With some his valor and
military skill only excited more ardent
admiration. One of his biographers
bursts out into this extraordinary panegyric
on the Archdeacon of Canterbury:
"Who can recount the carnage, the
desolation, which he made at the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of a strong body of soldiers? He attacked
castles, razed towns and cities to
the ground, burned down houses and
farms without a touch of pity, and
never showed the slightest mercy to any
one who rose in insurrection against his
master's <span class="locked">authority."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wealth of
Becket.</div>

<p>The services of Becket were not unrewarded;
the love and gratitude of
his sovereign showered honors and
emoluments upon him. Among his
grants were the wardenship of the
Tower of London, the lordship of the
castle of Berkhampstead and the honor
of Eye, with the service of a hundred
and forty knights. Yet there must
have been other and more prolific
sources of his wealth, so
lavishly displayed. Through his hands
as Chancellor passed almost all grants
and royal favors. He was the guardian
of all escheated baronies and of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
vacant benefices. It is said in his praise
that he did not permit the king, as was
common, to prolong those vacancies for
his own advantage, that they were filled
up with as much speed as possible; but
it should seem, by subsequent occurrences,
that no very strict account was
kept of the king's monies spent by the
Chancellor in the king's service and
those expended by the Chancellor himself.
This seems intimated by the care
which he took to secure a general quittance
from the chief justiciary of the
realm before his elevation to the archbishopric.</p>

<p>But if in his personal habits and occupations
Becket lost in some degree
the churchman in the secular dignitary,
was he mindful of the solemn trust imposed
upon him by his patron the archbishop,
and true to the interests of his
order? Did he connive at, or at least
did he not resist, any invasion on ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
immunities, or, as they were
called, the liberties of the clergy? did
he hold their property absolutely sacred?
It is clear that he consented to levy the
scutage, raised on the whole realm, on
ecclesiastical as well as secular property.
All that his friend John of Salisbury
can allege in his defence is, that he bitterly
repented of having been the minister
of this <span class="locked">iniquity.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> "If with Saul he
persecuted the Church, with Paul he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
prepared to die for the Church." But
probably the worst effect of this conduct
as regards King Henry was the encouragement
of his fatal delusion that, as
archbishop, Becket would be as submissive
to his wishes in the affairs of the
Church as had been the pliant Chancellor.
It was the last and crowning mark
of the royal confidence that Becket was
intrusted with the education of the
young Prince Henry, the heir to all the
dominions of the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April, 1161.</div>

<p>Six years after the accession of Henry
II. died Theobald Archbishop
of Canterbury. On the character of his
successor depended the peace of the
realm, especially if Henry, as no doubt
he did, already entertained designs of
limiting the exorbitant power of the
Church. Becket, ever at his right hand,
could not but occur to the mind of the
king. Nothing in his habits of life or
conduct could impair the hope that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
him the loyal, the devoted, it might
seem unscrupulous subject, would predominate
over the rigid churchman.
With such a prime minister, attached
by former benefits, it might seem by
the warmest personal love, still more
by this last proof of boundless confidence,
to his person, and as holding the
united offices of Chancellor and Primate,
ruling supreme both in Church and
State, the king could dread no resistance,
or if there were resistance, could
subdue it without difficulty.</p>

<p>Rumor had already designated Becket
as the future primate. A churchman,
the Prior of Leicester, on a visit to
Becket, who was ill at Rouen, pointing
to his apparel, said, "Is this a dress for
an Archbishop of Canterbury?" Becket
himself had not disguised his hopes and
fears. "There are three poor priests in
England, any one of whose elevation to
the see of Canterbury I should wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
rather than my own. I know the very
heart of the king; if I should be promoted,
I must forfeit his favor or that
of <span class="locked">God."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span></p>

<p>The king did not suddenly declare
his intentions. The see was vacant for
above a <span class="locked">year,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> and the administration of
the revenues must have been in the department
of the Chancellor. At length
as Becket, who had received a commission
to return to England on other affairs
of moment, took leave of his sovereign
at Falaise, Henry hastily informed
him that those affairs were not the main
object of his mission to England&mdash;it was
for his election to the vacant archbishopric.
Becket remonstrated, but in vain;
he openly warned, it is said, his royal
master that as Primate he must choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
between the favor of God and that of
the king&mdash;he must prefer that of <span class="locked">God.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span>
In those days the interests of the clergy
and of God were held inseparable.
Henry no doubt thought this but the
decent resistance of an ambitious prelate.
The advice of Henry of Pisa, the
Papal Legate, overcame the faint and
lingering scruples of Becket: he passed
to England with the king's recommendation,
mandate it might be called, for
his election.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
All which to the king would designate
Becket as the future Primate could
not but excite the apprehensions of the
more rigorous churchmen. The monks
of Canterbury, with whom rested the
formal election, alleged as an insuperable
difficulty that Becket had never
worn the monastic habit, as almost all
his predecessors had <span class="locked">done.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> The suffragan
bishops would no doubt secretly
resist the advancement, over all their
heads, of a man who, latterly at least,
had been more of a soldier, a courtier,
and a lay statesman. Nor could the
prophetic sagacity of any but the wisest
discern the latent churchmanship in the
ambitious and inflexible heart of Becket.
It is recorded on authority, which I do
not believe doubtful as to its authenticity,
but which is the impassioned
statement of a declared enemy, that
nothing but the arrival of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
justiciary, Richard de Luci, with the
king's peremptory commands, and with
personal menaces of proscription and
exile against the more forward opponents,
awed the refractory monks and
prelates to submission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gilbert Foliot.</div>

<p>At Whitsuntide Thomas Becket received
priest's orders, and was then consecrated
Primate of England with great
magnificence in the Abbey of Westminster.
The see of London being
vacant, the ceremony was performed by
the once turbulent, now aged and peaceful,
Henry of Winchester, the brother
of King Stephen. One voice alone, that
of Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of <span class="locked">Hereford,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
broke the apparent harmony by a
bitter sarcasm&mdash;"The king has
wrought a miracle; he has turned a
soldier and a layman into an archbishop."
Gilbert Foliot, from
first to last the firm and unawed antagonist
of Becket, is too important a personage
to be passed lightly <span class="locked">by.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sally was attributed no doubt by some
at the time, as it was the subject afterwards
of many fierce taunts from Becket
himself, and of lofty vindication by
Foliot, to disappointed ambition, as
though he himself aspired to the primacy.
Nor was there an ecclesiastic
in England who might entertain more
just hopes of advancement. He was
admitted to be a man of unimpeachable
life, of austere habits, and great learning.
He had been Abbot of Gloucester
and then Bishop of Hereford. He
was in correspondence with four successive
Popes, C&oelig;lestine II., Lucius II.,
Eugenius III., Alexander, and with a
familiarity which implies a high estimation
for ability and experience. He is
interfering in matters remote from his
diocese, and commending other bishops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Lincoln and Salisbury, to the favorable
consideration of the Pontiff. All his
letters reveal as imperious and conscientious
a churchman as Becket himself,
and in Becket's position Foliot might
have resisted the king as <span class="locked">inflexibly.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span>
He was, in short, a bold and stirring
ecclesiastic, who did not scruple to
wield, as he had done in several instances,
that last terrible weapon of the
clergy which burst on his own head,
<span class="locked">excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> It may be added
that, notwithstanding his sarcasm, there
was no open breach between him and
Becket. The primate acquiesced in, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he did not promote, the advancement
of Foliot to the see of <span class="locked">London;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> and
during that period letters of courtesy
which borders on adulation were interchanged
at least with apparent <span class="locked">sincerity.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span></p>

<p>The king had indeed wrought a
greater miracle than himself intended,
or than Foliot thought possible. Becket
became at once not merely a decent
prelate, but an austere and mortified
monk: he seemed determined to make
up for his want of ascetic qualifications;
to crowd a whole life of monkhood into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a few <span class="locked">years.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> Under his canonical dress
he wore a monk's frock, haircloth next
his skin; his studies, his devotions, were
long, regular, rigid. At the mass he
was frequently melted into passionate
tears. In his outward demeanor, indeed,
though he submitted to private
flagellation, and the most severe macerations,
Becket was still the stately prelate:
his food, though scanty to abstemiousness,
was, as his constitution required,
more delicate; his charities were
boundless. Archbishop Theobald had
doubled the usual amount of the primate's
alms, Becket again doubled that;
and every night in privacy, no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
more ostentatious than the most public
exhibition, with his own hands he
washed the feet of thirteen beggars.
His table was still hospitable and sumptuous,
but instead of knights and nobles,
he admitted only learned clerks,
and especially the regulars, whom he
courted with the most obsequious deference.
For the sprightly conversation
of former times were read grave books
in the Latin of the Church.</p>

<p>But the change was not alone in his
habits and mode of life. The King
could not have reproved, he might have
admired, the most punctilious regard for
the decency and the dignity of the highest
ecclesiastic in the realm. But the
inflexible churchman began to betray
himself in more unexpected acts. While
still in France Henry was startled at
receiving a peremptory resignation of
the chancellorship, as inconsistent with
the religious functions of the primate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
This act was as it were a bill of divorce
from all personal intimacy with the king,
a dissolution of their old familiar and
friendly intercourse. It was not merely
that the holy and austere prelate withdrew
from the unbecoming pleasures
of the court, the chase, the banquet,
the tournament, even the war; they
were no more to meet at the council
board, and the seat of judicature. It
had been said that Becket was co-sovereign
with the king, he now appeared
(and there were not wanting secret and
invidious enemies to suggest, and to inflame
the suspicion) a rival <span class="locked">sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span>
The king, when Becket met him on his
landing at Southampton, did not attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to conceal his dissatisfaction; his
reception of his old friend was cold.</p>

<p>It were unjust to human nature, to
suppose that it did not cost Becket a
violent struggle, a painful sacrifice,
thus as it were to rend himself from
the familiarity and friendship of his
munificent benefactor. It was no doubt
a severe sense of duty which crushed
his natural affections, especially as vulgar
ambition must have pointed out a
more sure and safe way to power and
fame. Such ambition would hardly
have hesitated between the ruling all
orders through the king, and the solitary
and dangerous position of opposing
so powerful a monarch to maintain the
interests and secure the favor of one
order alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket at
Tours. May
19, 1163.</div>

<p>Henry was now fully occupied with
the affairs of Wales. Becket, with the
royal sanction, obeyed the summons
of Pope Alexander to the Council of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Tours. Becket had passed through part
of France at the head of an army of his
own raising, and under his command;
he had passed a second time as representing
the king; he was yet to pass as
an exile. At Tours, where
Pope Alexander now held his
court, and presided over his council,
Becket appeared at the head of all the
Bishops of England, except those excused
on account of age or infirmity.
So great was his reputation, that the
Pope sent out all the cardinals except
those in attendance on his own person
to escort the primate of England into
the city. In the council at Tours not
merely was the title of Alexander to
the popedom avouched with perfect
unanimity, but the rights and privileges
of the clergy asserted with more than
usual rigor and distinctness. Some
canons, one especially which severely
condemned all encroachments on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
property of the Church, might seem
framed almost with a view to the impending
strife with England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning
of strife.</div>

<p>That strife, so impetuous might seem
the combatants to join issue,
broke out, during the next year,
in all its violence. Both parties, if they
did not commence, were prepared for
aggression. The first occasion of public
collision was a dispute concerning
the customary payment of the ancient
Danegelt, of two shillings on every hide
of land, to the sheriffs of the several
counties. The king determined to
transfer this payment to his own exchequer:
he summoned an assembly at
Woodstock, and declared his intentions.
All were mute but Becket; the archbishop
opposed the enrolment of the
decree, on the ground that the tax was
voluntary, not of right. "By the eyes
of God," said Henry, his usual oath,
"it shall be enrolled!" "By the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
eyes, by which you swear," replied the
prelate, "it shall never be levied on
my lands while I <span class="locked">live!"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> On Becket's
part, almost the first act of his primacy
was to vindicate all the rights, and to
resume all the property which had been
usurped, or which he asserted to have
been usurped, from his <span class="locked">see.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> It was not
likely that, in the turbulent times just
gone by, there would have been rigid
respect for the inviolability of sacred
property. The title of the Church was
held to be indefeasible. Whatever had
once belonged to the Church might be
recovered at any time; and the ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
courts claimed the sole right of
adjudication in such causes. The primate
was thus at once plaintiff, judge,
and carried into execution his own
judgments. The lord of the manor of
Eynsford in Kent, who held of the king,
claimed the right of presentation to that
benefice. Becket asserted the prerogative
of the see of Canterbury. On the
forcible ejectment of his nominee by
the lord, William of Eynsford, Becket
proceeded at once to a sentence of excommunication,
without regard to Eynsford's
feudal superior the king. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Claims of Becket.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The primate next demanded the castle of
Tunbridge from the head of the powerful
family of De Clare; though it had
been held by De Clare, and it
was asserted, received in exchange
for a Norman Castle, since the
time of William the Conqueror. The
attack on De Clare might seem a defiance
of the whole feudal nobility: a determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to despoil them of their conquests,
or grants from the sovereign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Immunities
of the
clergy.</div>

<p>The king, on his side, wisely chose
the strongest and more popular ground
of the immunities of the clergy from all
temporal jurisdiction. He appeared as
guardian of the public morals, as administrator
of equal justice to all his
subjects, as protector of the
peace of the realm. Crimes
of great atrocity, it is said, of great frequency,
crimes such as robbery and
homicide, crimes for which secular
persons were hanged by scores and
without mercy, were committed almost
with impunity, or with punishment
altogether inadequate to the offence by
the clergy; and the sacred name of
clerk, exempted not only bishops, abbots,
and priests, but those of the lowest
ecclesiastical rank from the civil
power. It was the inalienable right of
the clerk to be tried only in the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of his bishop; and as that court could
not award capital punishment, the utmost
penalties were flagellation, imprisonment,
and degradation. It was only
after degradation, and for a second
offence (for the clergy strenuously insisted
on the injustice of a second trial
for the same <span class="locked">act,)<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> that the meanest of
the clerical body could be brought to
the level of the most highborn layman.
But to cede one tittle of these immunities,
to surrender the sacred person of a
clergyman, whatever his guilt, to the
secular power, was treason to the sacerdotal
order: it was giving up Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
(for the Redeemer was supposed actually
to dwell in the clerk, though his
hands might be stained with innocent
blood) to be crucified by the <span class="locked">heathen.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span>
To mutilate the person of one in holy
orders was directly contrary to the
Scripture (for with convenient logic,
while the clergy rejected the example
of the Old Testament as to the equal
liability of priest and Levite with the
ordinary Jew to the sentence of the law,
they alleged it on their own part as unanswerable.)
It was inconceivable, that
hands which had but now made God
should be tied behind the back, like
those of a common malefactor, or that
his neck should be wrung on a gibbet,
before whom kings had but now bowed
in reverential <span class="locked">homage.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span></p>

<p>The enormity of the evil is acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by Becket's most ardent <span class="locked">partisans.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span>
The king had credible information
laid before him that some of the
clergy were absolute devils in guilt,
that their wickedness could not be
repressed by the ordinary means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
justice, and were daily growing worse.</p>

<p>Becket himself had protected some
notorious and heinous offenders. A
clerk of the diocese of Worcester had
debauched a maiden and murdered her
father. Becket ordered the man to be
kept in prison, and refused to surrender
him to the king's <span class="locked">justice.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> Another in
London, guilty of stealing a silver goblet,
was claimed as only amenable to
the ecclesiastical court. Philip de
Brois, a canon of Bedford, had been
guilty of homicide. The cause was
tried in the bishop's court; he was
condemned to pay a fine to the kindred
of the slain man. Some time after,
Fitz-Peter, the king's justiciary, whether
from private enmity or offence, or
dissatisfied with the ecclesiastical verdict,
in the open court at Dunstable,
called De Brois a murderer. De Brois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
broke out into angry and contumelious
language against the judge. The insult
to the justiciary was held to be insult
to the king, who sought justice,
where alone he could obtain it, in the
bishop's court. Philip de Brois this
time incurred a sentence, to our notions
almost as disproportionate as that for
his former offence. He was condemned
to be publicly whipped, and degraded
for two years from the honors
and emoluments of his canonry. But
to the king the verdict appeared far too
lenient; the spiritual jurisdiction was
accused as shielding the criminal from
his due penalty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the King.</div>

<p>Such were the questions on which
Becket was prepared to confront
and to wage war to the death
with the king; and all this with a deliberate
knowledge both of the power
and the character of Henry, his power
as undisputed sovereign of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and of continental territories more extensive
and flourishing than those of
the king of France. These dominions
included those of the Conqueror and
his descendants, of the Counts of Anjou,
and the great inheritance of his wife,
Queen Eleanor, the old kingdom of
Aquitaine; they reached from the
borders of Flanders round to the foot
of the Pyrenees. This almost unrivaled
power could not but have worked
with the strong natural passions of
Henry to form the character drawn by
a churchman of great ability, who
would warn Becket as to the formidable
adversary whom he had undertaken to
oppose,&mdash;"You have to deal with one
on whose policy the most distant sovereigns
of Europe, on whose power his
neighbors, on whose severity his subjects
look with awe; whom constant
successes and prosperous fortune have
rendered so sensitive, that every act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
disobedience is a personal outrage;
whom it is as easy to provoke as difficult
to appease; who encourages no
rash offence by impunity, but whose
vengeance is instant and summary. He
will sometimes be softened by humility
and patience, but will never submit to
compulsion; everything must seem to
be conceded by his own free will, nothing
wrested from his weakness. He is
more covetous of glory than of gain, a
commendable quality in a prince, if
virtue and truth, not the vanity and
soft flattery of courtiers, awarded that
glory. He is a great, indeed the greatest
of kings, for he has no superior of
whom he may stand in dread, no subject
who dares to resist him. His natural
ferocity has been subdued by no
calamity from without; all who have
been involved in any contest with him,
have preferred the most precarious
treaty to a trial of strength with one so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
pre-eminent in wealth, in the number
of his forces, and the greatness of his
<span class="locked">puissance."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span></p>

<p>A king of this character would eagerly
listen to suggestions of interested or
flattering courtiers, that unless the
Primate's power were limited, the authority
of the king would be reduced to
nothing. The succession to the throne
would depend entirely on the clergy,
and he himself would reign only so
long as might seem good to the Archbishop.
Nor were they the baser courtiers
alone who feared and hated Becket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The nobles might tremble from the example
of De Clare, with whose powerful
house almost all the Norman baronage
was allied, lest every royal grant
should be called in <span class="locked">question.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> Even
among the clergy Becket had bitter
enemies; and though at first they appeared
almost as jealous as the Primate
for the privileges of their order, the
most able soon espoused the cause of
the King; those who secretly favored
him were obliged to submit in silence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of Westminster.</div>

<p>The King, determined to bring these
great questions to issue summoned
a Parliament at Westminster.
He commenced the proceedings by enlarging
on the abuses of the archidiaconal
courts. The archdeacons kept
the most watchful and inquisitorial
superintendence over the laity, but
every offence was easily commuted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a pecuniary fine, which fell to them.
The King complained that they levied
a revenue from the sins of the people
equal to his own, yet that the public
morals were only more deeply and irretrievably
depraved. He then demanded
that all clerks accused of heinous
crimes should be immediately degraded
and handed over to the officers
of his justice, to be dealt with according
to law; for their guilt, instead of
deserving a lighter punishment, was
doubly guilty: he demanded this in
the name of equal justice and the peace
of the realm. Becket insisted on delay
till the next morning, in order that he
might consult his suffragan bishops.
This the King refused: the bishops
withdrew to confer upon their answer.
The bishops were disposed to yield,
some doubtless impressed with the justice
of the demand, some from fear of
the King, some from a prudent conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the danger of provoking so
powerful a monarch, and of involving
the Church in a quarrel with Henry at
the perilous time of a contest for the
Papacy which distracted Europe. Becket
inflexibly maintained the inviolability
of the holy persons of the <span class="locked">clergy.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span>
The King then demanded whether they
would observe the "customs of the
realm." "Saving my order," replied
the Archbishop. That order was still
to be exempt from all jurisdiction but
its own. So answered all the bishops
except Hilary of Chichester, who made
the declaration without <span class="locked">reserve.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> The
King hastily broke up the assembly,
and left London in a state of consternation,
the people and the clergy agitated
by conflicting anxieties. He immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
deprived Becket of the custody of
the Royal Castles, which he still retained,
and of the momentous charge, the
education of his son. The bishops entreated
Becket either to withdraw or to
change the offensive word. At first he
declared that if an angel from Heaven
should counsel such weakness, he would
hold him accursed. At length, however,
he yielded, as Herbert de Bosham
asserts out of love for the <span class="locked">King,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> by
another account at the persuasion of
the Pope's Almoner, said to have been
bribed by English <span class="locked">gold.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> He went to
Oxford and made the concession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 1164.</div>

<p>The King, in order to ratify with the
utmost solemnity the concession
extorted from the bishops, and even
from Becket himself, summoned a great
council of the realm to Clarendon,
a royal palace between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
three and four miles from Salisbury.  <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Council of Clarendon.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The two archbishops and eleven bishops,
between thirty and forty of the highest
nobles, with numbers of inferior barons,
were present. It was the King's object
to settle beyond dispute the main
points in contest between the Crown
and the Church; to establish thus, with
the consent of the whole nation, an
English Constitution in Church and
State. Becket, it is said, had been assured
by some about the King that a
mere assent would be demanded to
vague and ambiguous, and therefore on
occasion disputable customs. But
when these customs, which had been
collected and put in writing by the
King's order, appeared in the form of
precise and binding laws, drawn up
with legal technicality by the Chief
Justiciary, he saw his error, wavered,
and endeavored to <span class="locked">recede.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> The King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
broke out into one of his ungovernable
fits of passion. One or two of the
bishops who were out of favor with the
King and two knights Templars on
their knees implored Becket to abandon
his dangerous, fruitless, and ill-timed
resistance. The Archbishop took the
oath, which had been already sworn to
by all the lay barons. He was followed
by the rest of the bishops, reluctantly
according to one account,
and compelled on one side by their
dread of the lay barons, on the other
by the example and authority of the
Primate, according to Becket's biographers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
eagerly and of their own <span class="locked">accord.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Constitutions
of Clarendon.</div>

<p>These famous constitutions were of
course feudal in their form and spirit.
But they aimed at the subjection of all
the great prelates of the realm
to the Crown to the same extent
as the great barons. The new constitution
of England made the bishops'
fiefs to be granted according to the
royal will, and subjected the whole of
the clergy equally with the laity to the
common laws of the <span class="locked">land.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> I. On the
vacancy of every archbishopric, bishopric,
abbey, or priory, the revenues came
into the King's hands. He was to summon
those who had the right of election,
which was to take place in the King's
Chapel, with his consent, and the counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of nobles chosen by the King for
this office. The prelate elect was immediately
to do homage to the King as
his liege lord, for life, limb, and worldly
honors, excepting his order. The archbishops,
bishops, and all beneficiaries,
held their estates on the tenure of
baronies, amenable to the King's justice,
and bound to sit with the other
barons in all pleas of the Crown, except
in capital cases. No archbishop, bishop,
or any other person could quit the
realm without royal permission, or without
taking an oath at the King's requisition,
not to do any damage either
going, staying, or returning, to the King
or the kingdom.</p>

<p>II. All clerks accused of any crime
were to be summoned before the King's
Courts. The King's justiciaries were
to decide whether it was a case for civil
or ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Those
which belonged to the latter were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
removed to the Bishops' Court. If the
clerk was found guilty or confessed his
guilt, the Church could protect him no
<span class="locked">longer.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span></p>

<p>III. All disputes concerning advowsons
and presentations to benefices were
to be decided in the King's Courts; and
the King's consent was necessary for the
appointment to any benefice within the
King's <span class="locked">domain.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span></p>

<p>IV. No tenant in chief of the King,
none of the officers of the King's household,
could be excommunicated, nor his
lands placed under interdict, until due
information had been laid before the
King; or, in his absence from the realm,
before the great Justiciary, in order that
he might determine in each case the
respective rights of the civil and ecclesiastical
<span class="locked">courts.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
V. Appeals lay from the archdeacon
to the bishop, from the bishop to the
Archbishop. On failure of justice by
the Archbishop, in the last resort to
the King, who was to take care that
justice was done in the Archbishop's
Court; and no further appeal was to be
made without the King's consent. This
was manifestly and avowedly intended
to limit appeals to Rome.</p>

<p>All these statutes, in number sixteen,
were restrictions on the distinctive
immunities of the clergy; one, and
that unnoticed, was really an invasion
of popular freedom; no son of a villein
could be ordained without the consent
of his lord.</p>

<p>Some of these customs were of doubtful
authenticity. On the main question,
the exorbitant powers of the ecclesiastical
courts and the immunity of the
clergy from all other jurisdiction, there
was an unrepealed statute of William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the Conqueror. Before the Conquest
the bishop sate with the alderman in
the same court. The statute of William
created a separate jurisdiction of great
extent in the spiritual court. This was
not done to aggrandize the Church, of
which in some respects the Conqueror
was jealous, but to elevate the importance
of the great Norman prelates
whom he had thrust into the English
sees. It raised another class of powerful
feudatories to support the foreign
throne, bound to it by common interest
as well as by the attachment of race.
But at this time neither party took any
notice of the ancient statute. The King's
advisers of course avoided the dangerous
question; Becket and the Churchmen
(Becket himself declared that he
was unlearned in the customs), standing
on the divine and indefeasible right of
the clergy, could hardly rest on a recent
statute granted by the royal will, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
therefore liable to be annulled by the
same authority. The Customs, they
averred, were of themselves illegal, as
clashing with higher irrepealable laws.</p>

<p>To these Customs Becket had now
sworn without reserve. Three copies
were ordered to be made&mdash;one for the
Archbishop of Canterbury, one for
York, one to be laid up in the royal
archives. To these the King demanded
the further guarantee of the seal of
the different parties. The Primate,
whether already repenting of his assent,
or under the vague impression that this
was committing himself still further
(for oaths might be absolved, seals could
not be torn from public documents),
now obstinately refused to make any
further concession. The refusal threw
suspicion on the sincerity of his former
act. The King, the other prelates, the
nobles, all but <span class="locked">Becket,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> subscribed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sealed the Constitutions of Clarendon as
the laws of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 1.</div>

<p>As the Primate rode from Winchester
in profound silence, meditating on
the acts of the council and on his own
conduct, one of his attendants, who has
himself related the conversation, endeavored
to raise his spirits. "It is a fit
punishment," said Becket, "for one
who, not trained in the school of the
Saviour, but in the King's court, a man
of pride and vanity, from a follower of
hawks and hounds, a patron of players,
has dared to assume the care of so many
<span class="locked">souls."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> De Bosham significantly reminded
his master of St. Peter, his
denial of the Lord, his subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
repentance. On his return to Canterbury
Becket imposed upon himself
the severest mortification, and suspended
himself from his function of offering
the sacrifice on the altar. He wrote
almost immediately to the Pope
to seek counsel and absolution from his
oath. He received both. The absolution
restored all his vivacity.</p>

<p>But the King had likewise his emissaries
with the Pope at Sens. He
endeavored to obtain a legatine commission
over the whole realm of England
for Becket's enemy, Roger Archbishop
of York, and a recommendation
from the Pope to Becket to observe the
"customs" of the realm. Two embassies
were sent by the King for this end:
first the Bishops of Lisieux and Poitiers;
then Geoffrey Ridel, Archdeacon of
Canterbury (who afterwards appears so
hostile to the Primate as to be called by
him that archdevil, not archdeacon),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and the subtle John of Oxford. The
embarrassed Pope (throughout it must
be remembered that there was a formidable
Antipope), afraid at once of estranging
Henry, and unwilling to abandon
Becket, granted the legation to the
Archbishop of York. To the Primate's
great indignation, Roger had his cross
borne before him in the province of
Canterbury. On Becket's angry remonstrance,
the Pope, while on the one
hand he enjoined on Becket the greatest
caution and forbearance in the inevitable
contest, assured him that he would
never permit the see of Canterbury to
be subject to any authority but his
<span class="locked">own.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Becket secretly went down to his
estate at Romney, near the sea-coast, in
the hope of crossing the straits, and so
finding refuge and maintaining his cause
by his personal presence with the Pope.
Stormy weather forced him to abandon
his design. He then betook himself to
the King at Woodstock. He was coldly
received. The King at first dissembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
his knowledge of the Primate's
attempt to cross the sea, a direct violation
of one of the constitutions; but on
his departure he asked with bitter jocularity
whether Becket had sought to
leave the realm because England could
not contain himself and the <span class="locked">King.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span></p>

<p>The tergiversation of Becket, and his
attempt thus to violate one of the Constitutions
of Clarendon, to which he
had sworn, showed that he was not
to be bound by oaths. No treaty could
be made where one party claimed the
power of retracting, and might at any
time be released from his covenant. In
the mind of Henry, whose will had
never yet met resistance, the determination
was confirmed, if he could not subdue
the Prelate, to crush the refractory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
subject. Becket's enemies possessed
the King's ear. Some of those enemies
no doubt hated him for his former favor
with the King, some dreaded lest the
severity of so inflexible a prelate should
curb their license, some held property
belonging to or claimed by the Church,
some to flatter the King, some in honest
indignation at the duplicity of Becket
and in love of peace, but all concurred
to inflame the resentment of Henry, and
to attribute to Becket words and designs
insulting to the King and disparaging
to the royal authority. Becket,
holding such notions as he did of Church
power, would not be cautious in asserting
it; and whatever he might utter in
his pride would be embittered rather
than softened when repeated to the
King.</p>

<p>Since the Council of Clarendon Becket
stood alone. All the higher clergy,
the great prelates of the kingdom, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
now either his open adversaries or were
compelled to dissemble their favor towards
him. Whether alienated, as
some declared, by his pusillanimity at
Clarendon, bribed by the gifts or overawed
by the power of the King, whether
conscientiously convinced that in
such times of schism and division it
might be fatal to the interests of the
Church to advance her loftiest pretensions,
all, especially the Archbishop of
York, the Bishops of London, Salisbury
and Chichester, were arrayed on the
King's side. Becket himself attributed
the chief guilt of his persecution to the
bishops. "The King would have been
quiet if they had not been so tamely
subservient to his <span class="locked">wishes."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament at
Northampton.
Oct. 6, 1164.</div>

<p>Before the close of the year Becket was
cited to appear before a great council of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the realm at Northampton.
All England crowded to witness
this final strife, it might be between
the royal and the ecclesiastical power.
The Primate entered Northampton with
only his own retinue; the King had
passed the afternoon amusing himself
with hawking in the pleasant meadows
around. The Archbishop, on the following
morning after mass, appeared
in the King's chamber with a cheerful
countenance. The King gave not, according
to English custom, the kiss of
peace.</p>

<p>The citation of the Primate before
the King in council at Northampton
was to answer a charge of withholding
justice from John the Marshall employed
in the king's exchequer, who
claimed the estate of Pagaham from
the see of Canterbury. Twice had
Becket been summoned to appear in
the king's court to answer for this denial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of justice: once he had refused to appear,
the second time he did not appear
in person. Becket in vain alleged an
informality in the original proceedings
of John the <span class="locked">Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> The court, the
bishops, as well as the barons, declared
him guilty of contumacy; all his goods
and chattels became, according to the
legal phrase, at the king's <span class="locked">mercy.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span>
The fine was assessed at 500 pounds.
Becket submitted, not without bitter
irony: "This, then, is one of the new
customs of Clarendon." But he protested
against the unheard-of audacity
that the bishops should presume to sit
in judgment on their spiritual parent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
it was a greater crime than to uncover
their father's <span class="locked">nakedness.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> Sarcasms
and protests passed alike without notice.
But the bishops, all except Foliot,
consented to become sureties for
this exorbitant fine. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Demands on Becket.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Demands
rising one above another seemed framed
for the purpose of reducing the Archbishop
to the humiliating condition of
a debtor to the King, entirely at his
disposal. First 300 pounds were demanded
as due from the castles of Eye
and Berkhampstead. Becket pleaded
that he had expended a much larger
sum on the repairs of the castles: he
found sureties likewise for this payment,
the Earl of Gloucester, William
of Eynsford, and another of "his men."
The next day the demand was for 500
pounds lent by the King during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
siege of Toulouse, Becket declared that
this was a gift, not a <span class="locked">loan;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> but the
King denying the plea, judgment was
again entered against Becket. At
last came the overwhelming charge, an
account of all the monies received during
his chancellorship from the vacant
archbishopric and from other bishoprics
and abbeys. The debt was calculated
at the enormous sum of 44,000 marks.
Becket was astounded at this unexpected
claim. As chancellor, in all likelihood,
he had kept no very strict account
of what was expended in his own
and in the royal service; and the King
seemed blind to this abuse of the royal
right, by which so large a sum had accumulated
by keeping open those benefices
which ought to have been instantly
filled. Becket, recovered from his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
amazement, replied that he had not
been cited to answer on such charge; at
another time he should be prepared to
answer all just demands of the Crown.
He now requested delay, in order to
advise with his suffragans and the
clergy. He withdrew; but from that
time no single baron visited the object
of the royal disfavor. Becket assembled
all the poor, even the beggars,
who could be found, to fill his vacant
board.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Takes counsel
with the
bishops.</div>

<p>In his extreme exigency the Primate
consulted separately first the
bishops, then the abbots.
Their advice was different according to
their characters and their sentiments
towards him. He had what might seem
an unanswerable plea, a formal acquittance
from the Chief Justiciary De Luci,
the King's representative, for all obligations
incurred in his civil capacity
before his consecration as <span class="locked">archbishop.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
The King, however, it was
known, declared that he had given
no such authority. Becket had the
further excuse that all which he now
possessed was the property of the
Church, and could not be made liable
for responsibilities incurred in a secular
capacity. The bishops, however,
were either convinced of the
insufficiency or the inadmissibility of
that plea. Henry of Winchester recommended
an endeavor to purchase the
King's pardon; he offered 2000 marks
as his contribution. Others urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Becket to stand on his dignity, to defy
the worst, under the shelter of his
priesthood; no one would venture to
lay hands on a holy prelate. Foliot
and his party betrayed their <span class="locked">object.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span>
They exhorted him as the only way of
averting the implacable wrath of the
King at once to resign his see. "Would,"
said Hilary of Chichester, "you were
no longer archbishop, but plain Thomas.
Thou knowest the King better
than we do; he has declared that thou
and he cannot remain together in England,
he as King, thou as Primate.
Who will be bound for such an amount?
Throw thyself on the King's mercy, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to the eternal disgrace of the Church
thou wilt be arrested and imprisoned
as a debtor to the Crown." The next
day was Sunday; the Archbishop did
not leave his lodgings. On Monday
the agitation of his spirits had brought
on an attack of a disorder to which he
was subject: he was permitted to repose.
On the morrow he had determined on
his conduct. At one time he had seriously
meditated on a more humiliating
course: he proposed to seek the royal
presence barefooted with the cross in
his hands, to throw himself at the King's
feet, appealing to his old affection, and
imploring him to restore peace to the
Church. What had been the effect of
such a step on the violent but not ungenerous
heart of Henry? But Becket
yielded to the haughtier counsels more
congenial to his own intrepid character.
He began by the significant act of celebrating,
out of its due order, the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of St. Stephen, the first martyr.
It contained passages of holy writ (as
no doubt Henry was instantly informed)
concerning "kings taking counsel
against the godly." The mass concluded;
in all the majesty of his holy
character, in his full pontifical habits,
himself bearing the archiepiscopal cross,
the Primate rode to the King's residence,
and dismounting entered
the royal hall. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Becket in the King's hall.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The cross seemed,
as it were, an uplifting of the banner
of the Church, in defiance of that
of the King, in the royal <span class="locked">presence;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> or
it might be in that awful imitation of
the Saviour, at which no scruple was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ever made by the bolder churchmen&mdash;it
was the servant of Christ who himself
bore his own cross. "What means
this new fashion of the Archbishop
bearing his own cross?" said the Archdeacon
Lisieux. "A fool," said Foliot,
"he always was and always will be."
They made room for him; he took his
accustomed seat in the centre of the
bishops. Foliot endeavored to persuade
him to lay down the cross. "If
the sword of the King and the cross of
the Archbishop were to come in conflict,
which were the more fearful weapon?"
Becket held the cross firmly, which
Foliot and the Bishop of Hereford
strove, but in vain, to wrest from his
grasp.</p>

<p>The bishops were summoned into the
King's presence: Becket sat alone in
the outer hall. The Archbishop of
York, who, as Becket's partisans asserted,
designedly came later that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
appear to be of the King's intimate
council, swept through the hall with his
cross borne before him. Like hostile
spears cross confronted <span class="locked">cross.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span></p>

<p>During this interval De Bosham, the
archbishop's reader, who had reminded
his master that he had been standard-bearer
of the King of England, and was
now the standard-bearer of the King of
the Angels, put this question, "If they
should lay their impious hands upon
thee, art thou prepared to fulminate
excommunication against them?" Fitz-Stephen,
who sat at his feet, said in a
loud clear voice, "That be far from thee;
so did not the Apostles and Martyrs of
God: they prayed for their persecutors
and forgave them." Some of his more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
attached followers burst into tears. "A
little later," says the faithful Fitz-Stephen
of himself, "when one of the
King's ushers would not allow me to
speak to the Archbishop, I made a sign
to him and drew his attention to the
Saviour on the cross."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condemnation of Becket.</div>

<p>The bishops admitted to the King's
presence announced the appeal of the
Archbishop to the Pope, and his inhibition
to his suffragans to sit in judgment
in a secular council on their
<span class="locked">metropolitan.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> These were again direct
infringements on two of the constitutions
of Clarendon, sworn to by
Becket in an oath still held valid by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
King and his barons. The King appealed
to the council. Some seized the
occasion of boldly declaring to the King
that he had brought this difficulty on
himself by advancing a low-born man
to such favor and dignity. All
agreed that Becket was guilty
of perjury and <span class="locked">treason.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span> A kind of
low acclamation followed which was
heard in the outer room and made
Becket's followers tremble. The King
sent certain counts and barons to demand
of Becket whether he, a liegeman
of the King, and sworn to observe the
constitutions of Clarendon, had lodged
this appeal and pronounced this inhibition?
The Archbishop replied with
quiet intrepidity. In his long speech
he did not hesitate for a word; he pleaded
that he had not been cited to answer
these charges; he alleged again the
Justiciary's acquittance; he ended by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
solemnly renewing his inhibition and
his appeal: "My person and my Church
I place under the protection of the
sovereign Pontiff."</p>

<p>The barons of Normandy and England
heard with wonder this defiance
of the King. Some seemed awe-struck
and were mute; the more fierce and
lawless could not restrain their indignation.
"The Conqueror knew best how
to deal with these turbulent churchmen.
He seized his own brother, Odo Bishop
of Bayeux, and chastised him for his
rebellion; he threw Stigand, Archbishop
of Canterbury, into a fetid dungeon.
The Count of Anjou, the King's
father, treated still worse the bishop
elect of Seez and many of his clergy:
he ordered them to be shamefully
mutilated and derided their sufferings."</p>

<p>The King summoned the bishops, on
their allegiance as barons, to join in
sentence against Becket. But the inhibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of their metropolitan had thrown
them into embarrassment, and perhaps
they felt that the offence of Becket, if
not capital treason, bordered upon it.
It might be a sentence of blood, in
which no churchman might concur by
his suffrage&mdash;they dreaded the breach
of canonical obedience. They entered
the hall where Becket sat alone. The
gentler prelates, Robert of Lincoln and
others, were moved to tears; even
Henry of Winchester advised the archbishop
to make an unconditional surrender
of his see. The more vehement
Hilary of Chichester addressed him
thus: "Lord Primate, we have just
cause of complaint against you. Your
inhibition has placed us between the
hammer and the anvil: if we disobey
it, we violate our canonical obedience;
if we obey, we infringe the constitutions
of the realm and offend the King's
majesty. Yourself were the first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
subscribe the customs at Clarendon,
you now compel us to break them. We
appeal, by the King's grace, to our lord
the Pope." Becket answered "I hear."</p>

<p>They returned to the King, and with
difficulty obtained an exemption from
concurrence in the sentence; they promised
to join in a supplication to the
Pope to depose Becket. The King permitted
their appeal. Robert Earl of
Leicester, a grave and aged nobleman,
was commissioned to pronounce the
sentence. Leicester had hardly begun
when Becket sternly interrupted him.
"Thy sentence! son and Earl, hear me
first! The King was pleased to promote
me against my will to the archbishopric
of Canterbury. I was then
declared free from all secular obligations.
Ye are my children; presume
ye against law and reason to sit in judgment
on your spiritual father? I am
to be judged only, under God, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Pope. To him I appeal, before him I
cite you, barons and my suffragans, to
appear. Under the protection of the
Catholic Church and the Apostolic See
I <span class="locked">depart!"<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> He rose and walked
slowly down the hall. A deep murmur
ran through the crowd. Some took up
straws and threw them at him. One
uttered the word "Traitor!" The old
chivalrous spirit woke in the soul of
Becket. "Were it not for my order,
you should rue that word." But by
other accounts he restrained not his
language to this pardonable impropriety&mdash;he
met scorn with scorn. One officer
of the King's household he upbraided
for having had a kinsman hanged.
Anselm, the King's brother, he called
"bastard and catamite." The door was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
locked, but fortunately the key was
found. He passed out into the street,
where he was received by the populace,
to whom he had endeared himself by
his charities, his austerities, perhaps by
his courageous opposition to the king
and the nobles, amid loud acclamations.
They pressed so closely around him for
his blessing that he could scarcely guide
his horse. He returned to the church
of St. Andrew, placed his cross by the
altar of the Virgin. "This was a fearful
day," said Fitz-Stephen. "The day
of judgment," he replied, "will be more
fearful." After supper he sent the
Bishops of Hereford, Worcester, and
Rochester to the King to request permission
to leave the kingdom: the King
coldly deferred his answer till the
morrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flight of Becket. Oct. 13.</div>

<p>Becket and his friends no doubt
thought his life in danger: he is said
to have received some alarming <span class="locked">warnings.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
It is reported, on the other
hand, that the King, apprehensive of
the fierce zeal of his followers, issued a
proclamation that no one should do
harm to the archbishop or his people.
It is more likely that the King, who
must have known the peril of attempting
the life of an archbishop, would
have apprehended and committed him
to prison. Becket expressed his intention
to pass the night in the church:
his bed was strewn before the altar.
At midnight he rose, and with
only two monks and a servant
stole out of the northern gate, the only
one which was not guarded. He carried
with him only his archiepiscopal pall
and his seal. The weather was wet and
stormy, but the next morning they
reached Lincoln, and lodged with a
pious citizen&mdash;piety and admiration of
Becket were the same thing. At Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
he took the disguise of a monk,
dropped down the Witham to a hermitage
in the fens belonging to the Cistercians
of Sempringham; thence by crossroads,
and chiefly by night, he found
his way to Estrey, about five miles from
Deal, a manor belonging to Christ
Church in Canterbury. He remained
there a week. On All Souls Day he
went on board a boat, just before morning,
and by the evening reached the
coast of Flanders. To avoid observation
he landed on the open shore near
Gravelines. His large, loose shoes made
it difficult to wade through the sand
without falling. He sat down in despair.
After some delay was obtained
for a prelate, accustomed to the prancing
war-horse or stately cavalcade, a
sorry nag without a saddle, and with a
wisp of hay for a bridle. But he soon
got weary and was fain to walk. He
had many adventures by the way. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was once nearly betrayed by gazing
with delight on a falcon upon a young
squire's wrist: his fright punished him
for his relapse into his secular vanities.
The host of a small inn recognized him
by his lofty look and the whiteness of
his hands. At length he arrived at the
monastery of Clair Marais, near St.
Omer: he was there joined by Herbert
de Bosham, who had been left behind
to collect what money he could at Canterbury;
he brought but 100 marks
and some plate. While he was in this
part of Flanders the Justiciary, Richard
de Luci, passed through the town on his
way to England. He tried in vain to
persuade the archbishop to return with
him: Becket suspected his friendly
overtures, or had resolutely determined
not to put himself again in the King's
power.</p>

<p>In the first access of indignation at
Becket's flight the King had sent orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
for strict watch to be kept in the ports
of the kingdom, especially Dover. The
next measure was to pre-occupy the
minds of the Count of Flanders, the
King of France, and the Pope against
his fugitive subject. Henry could not
but foresee how formidable an ally the
exile might become to his rivals and
enemies, how dangerous to his extensive
but ill-consolidated foreign dominions.
He might know that Becket would act
and be received as an independent potentate.
The rank of his ambassadors
implied the importance of their mission
to France. They were the Archbishop
of York, the Bishops of London, Exeter,
Chichester, and Worcester, the Earl of
Arundel, and three other distinguished
nobles. The same day that Becket
passed to Gravelines, they crossed from
Dover to <span class="locked">Calais.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket
in exile.</div>

<p>The Earl of Flanders, though with
some cause of hostility to Becket,
had offered him a refuge; yet
perhaps was not distinctly informed or
would not know that the exile was in
his <span class="locked">dominions.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> He received the King's
envoys with civility. The King of
France was at Compiègne. The
strongest passions in the feeble mind of
Louis VII. were jealousy of Henry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
England, and a servile bigotry to the
Church, to which he seemed determined
to compensate for the hostility and disobedience
of his youth. Against Henry,
personally, there were old causes of
hatred rankling in his heart, not the
less deep because they could not be
avowed. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>From 1152 to 1164.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Henry of England was now
the husband of Eleanor, who, after some
years of marriage, had contemptuously
divorced the King of France as a monk
rather than as a husband, had
thrown herself into the arms of
Henry and carried with her a dowry
as large as half the kingdom of France.
There had since been years either of
fierce war, treacherous negotiations, or
jealous and armed peace, between the
rival sovereigns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Louis of France.</div>

<p>Louis had watched, and received
regular accounts of the proceedings in
England; his admiration of Becket for
his lofty churchmanship and daring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
opposition to Henry was at its height,
scarcely disguised. He had already in
secret offered to receive Becket, not as
a fugitive, but as the sharer in his kingdom.
The ambassadors appeared before
Louis and presented a letter urging the
King of France not to admit within his
dominions the traitor Thomas, late
Archbishop of Canterbury. "Late
Archbishop! and who has presumed
to depose him? I am a
king, like my brother of England; I
should not dare to depose the meanest
of my clergy. Is this the King's gratitude
for the services of his Chancellor,
to banish him from France, as he has
done from <span class="locked">England?"<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> Louis wrote a
strong letter to the Pope, recommending
to his favor the cause of Becket as
his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambassadors at Sens.</div>

<p>The ambassadors passed onwards
to Sens, where resided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the Pope Alexander III., himself an exile,
and opposing his spiritual power to
the highest temporal authority, that of
the Emperor and his subservient Antipope.
Alexander was in a position of
extraordinary difficulty: on the one side
were gratitude to King Henry for his
firm support, and the fear of estranging
so powerful a sovereign, on whose unrivaled
wealth he reckoned as the main
strength of his cause; on the other, the
dread of offending the King of France,
also his faithful partisan, in whose dominions
he was a refugee, and the duty,
the interest, the strong inclination to
maintain every privilege of the hierarchy.
To Henry Alexander almost owed
his pontificate. His first and most faithful
adherents had been Theobald the
primate, the English Church, and Henry
King of England; and when the
weak Louis had entered into dangerous
negotiations at Lannes with the Emperor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
when at Dijon he had almost
placed himself in the power of Frederick,
and his voluntary or enforced defection
had filled Alexander with dread,
the advance of Henry of England with
a powerful force to the neighborhood
rescued the French king from his perilous
position. And now, though Victor
the Antipope was dead, a successor,
Guido of Crema, had been set up by
the imperial party, and Frederick would
lose no opportunity of gaining, if any
serious quarrel should alienate him from
Alexander, a monarch of such surpassing
power. An envoy from England,
John Cummin, was even now at the
imperial <span class="locked">court.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span></p>

<p>Becket's messengers, before the reception
of Henry's ambassadors by Pope
Alexander, had been admitted to a private
interview. The account of Becket's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
"fight with beasts" at Northampton,
and a skillful parallel with St. Paul,
had melted the heart of the Pontiff, as
he no doubt thought himself suffering
like persecutions, to a flood of tears.
How in truth could a Pope venture to
abandon such a champion of what
were called the liberties of the Church?
He had, in fact, throughout been in
secret correspondence with Becket.
Whenever letters could escape the
jealous watchfulness of the King,
they had passed between England and
<span class="locked">Sens.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The King's
ambassadors
at Sens.</div>

<p>The ambassadors of Henry were received
in state in the open
consistory. Foliot of London
began with his usual ability; his warmth
at length betrayed him into the Scriptural
citation,&mdash;"The wicked fleeth
when no man pursueth." "Forbear,"
said the Pope. "I will forbear him,"
answered Foliot. "It is for thine own
sake, not for his, that I bid thee forbear."
The Pope's severe manner
silenced the Bishop of London. Hilary,
Bishop of Chichester, who had overweening
confidence in his eloquence,
began a long harangue; but at a fatal
blunder in his Latin, the whole Italian
court burst into <span class="locked">laughter.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> The discomfited
orator tried in vain to proceed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
The Archbishop of York spoke with
prudent brevity. The Count of Arundel,
more cautious or less learned, used
his native Norman. His speech was
mild, grave, and conciliatory, and therefore
the most embarrassing to the Pontiff.
Alexander consented to send his
cardinal legates to England; but neither
the arguments of Foliot, nor those
of Arundel, who now rose to something
like a menace of recourse to the Antipope,
would induce him to invest them
with full power. The Pope would
entrust to none but to himself the prerogative
of final judgment. Alexander
mistrusted the venality of his cardinals,
and Henry's subsequent dealing with
some of them justified his <span class="locked">mistrust.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span>
He was himself inflexible to tempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
offers. The envoys privately proposed
to extend the payment of Peter's Pence
to almost all classes, and to secure the
tax in perpetuity to the see of Rome.
The ambassadors retreated in haste;
their commission had been limited to a
few days. The bishops, so strong was
the popular feeling in France for Becket,
had entered Sens as retainers for the
Earl of Arundel: they received intimation
that certain lawless knights in the
neighborhood had determined to waylay
and plunder these enemies of the
Church, and of the saintly Becket.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket
at Sens.</div>

<p>Far different was the progress of the
exiled primate. From St. Bertin he
was escorted by the Abbot, and by the
Bishop of Terouenne. He entered
France; he was met, as he approached
Soissons, by the King's brothers, the
Archbishop of Rheims, and a long train
of bishops, abbots, and dignitaries
of the church; he entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Soissons at the head of three hundred
horsemen. The interview of Louis
with Becket raised his admiration into
passion. As the envoys of Henry
passed on one side of the river, they
saw the pomp in which the ally of
the King of France, rather than the
exile from England, was approaching
Sens. The cardinals, whether from
prudence, jealousy, or other motives,
were cool in their reception of Becket.
The Pope at once granted the
honor of a public audience; he placed
Becket on his right hand, and would
not allow him to rise to speak. Becket,
after a skillful account of his hard
usage, spread out the parchment which
contained the Constitutions of Clarendon.
They were read; the whole Consistory
exclaimed against the violation
of ecclesiastical privileges. On further
examination the Pope acknowledged
that six of them were less evil than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
rest; on the remaining ten he pronounced
his unqualified condemnation.
He rebuked the weakness of Becket in
swearing to these articles, it is said,
with the severity of a father, the tenderness
of a <span class="locked">mother.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> He consoled him
with the assurance that he had atoned
by his sufferings and his patience for
his brief infirmity. Becket pursued his
advantage. The next day, by what
might seem to some trustful magnanimity,
to others, a skillful mode of getting
rid of certain objections which had
been raised concerning his election, he
tendered the resignation of his archiepiscopate
to the Pope. Some of the
more politic, it was said, more venal
cardinals, entreated the Pontiff to put
an end at once to this dangerous quarrel
by accepting the <span class="locked">surrender.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> But
the Pontiff (his own judgment being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
supported among others by the Cardinal
Hyacinth) restored to him the archiepiscopal
ring, thus ratifying his primacy.
He assured Becket of his protection,
and committed him to the hospitable
care of the Abbot of Pontigny,
a monastery about twelve leagues from
Sens. "So long have you lived in ease
and opulence, now learn the lessons of
poverty from the <span class="locked">poor."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> Yet Alexander
thought it prudent to inhibit any
proceedings of Becket against the King
till the following Easter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect on King Henry.</div>

<p>Becket's emissaries had been present
during the interview of Henry's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>ambassadors
with the Pope. Henry, no doubt,
received speedy intelligence of these
proceedings with Becket. He was at
Marlborough after a disastrous campaign
in <span class="locked">Wales.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Wrath of Henry.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>He issued
immediate orders to seize the
revenues of the Archbishop, and promulgated
a mandate to the bishops to
sequester the estates of all the clergy
who had followed him to France.
He forbade public prayers for the
Primate. In the exasperated state,
especially of the monkish mind, prayers
for Becket would easily slide into anathemas
against the king. The payment
of Peter's <span class="locked">Pence<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> to the Pope was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
suspended. All correspondence with
Becket was forbidden. But the resentment
of Henry was not satisfied. He
passed a sentence of banishment, and
ordered at once to be driven from the
kingdom all the primate's kinsmen,
dependents, and friends. Four hundred
persons, it is said, of both sexes, of every
age, even infants at the breast were included
(and it was the depth of winter)
in this relentless edict. Every adult
was to take an oath to proceed immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to Becket, in order that his eyes
might be shocked, and his heart wrung
by the miseries which he had brought
on his family and his friends. This order
was as inhumanly executed, as inhumanly
<span class="locked">enacted.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> It was intrusted to
Randulph de Broc, a fierce soldier, the
bitterest of Becket's personal enemies.
It was as impolitic as cruel. The
monasteries and convents of Flanders
and of France were thrown open to
the exiles with generous hospitality.
Throughout both these countries was
spread a multitude of persons appealing
to the pity, to the indignation of all
orders of the people, and so deepening
the universal hatred of Henry. The
enemy of the Church was self-convicted
of equal enmity to all Christianity of
heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket at Pontigny.</div>

<p>In his seclusion at Pontigny Becket
seemed determined to compensate by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the sternest monastic discipline
for that deficiency which had
been alleged on his election to the archbishopric.
He put on the coarse Cistercian
dress. He lived on the hard
and scanty Cistercian diet. Outwardly
he still maintained something of his old
magnificence and the splendor of his
station. His establishment of horses
and retainers was so costly, that his
sober friend, John of Salisbury, remonstrated
against the profuse expenditure.
Richer viands were indeed served on a
table apart, ostensibly for Becket; but
while he himself was content with the
pulse and gruel of the monks, those
meats and game were given away to the
beggars. His devotions were long and
secret, broken with perpetual groans.
At night he rose from the bed strewn
with rich coverings, as beseeming an
archbishop, and summoned his chaplain
to the work of flagellation. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
satisfied with this, he tore his flesh with
his nails, and lay on the cold floor, with
a stone for his pillow. His health suffered;
wild dreams, so reports one of
his attendants, haunted his broken
slumbers, of cardinals plucking out his
eyes, fierce assassins cleaving his tonsured
<span class="locked">crown.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span> His studies were neither
suited to calm his mind, nor to abase
his hierarchical haughtiness. He devoted
his time to the canon law, of
which the False Decretals now formed
an integral part; sacerdotal fraud justifying
the loftiest sacerdotal presumption.
John of Salisbury again interposed
with friendly remonstrance. He
urged him to withdraw from these undevotional
inquiries; he recommended
to him the works of a Pope of a different
character, the Morals of Gregory
the Great. He exhorted him to confer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with holy men on books of spiritual
improvement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations
with the
Emperor.</div>

<p>King Henry in the meantime took a
loftier and more menacing tone towards
the Pope. "It is an unheard
of thing that the court of Rome
should support traitors against my
sovereign authority; I have not deserved
such <span class="locked">treatment.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> I am still more
indignant that the justice is denied to
me which is granted to the meanest
clerk." In his wrath he made overtures
to Reginald, Archbishop of
Cologne, the maker, he might be called,
of two Antipopes, and the minister of
the Emperor, declaring that he had
long sought an opportunity of falling
off from Alexander, and his perfidious
cardinals, who presumed to support
against him the traitor Thomas, late
Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet at
Wurtzburg,
<span class="smcap small locked">A. D.</span> 1165,
Whitsuntide.</div>

<p>The Emperor met the advances of
Henry with promptitude, which showed
the importance he attached to the alliance.
Reginald of Cologne was sent to
England to propose a double alliance
with the house of Swabia, of Frederick's
son, and of Henry the Lion, with the
two daughters of Henry Plantagenet.
The Pope trembled at this threatened
union between the houses of Swabia
and England. At the great diet held
at Wurtzburg, Frederick, asserted
the canonical election
of Paschal III., the new Antipope,
and declared in the face of the
empire and of all Christendom, that the
powerful kingdom of England had now
embraced his cause, and that the King
of France stood alone in his support of
<span class="locked">Alexander.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> In his public edict he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
declared to all Christendom that the
oath of fidelity to Paschal, of denial of
all future allegiance to Alexander, administered
to all the great princes and
prelates of the empire, had been taken
by the ambassadors of King Henry,
Richard of Ilchester, and John of <span class="locked">Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span>
Nor was this all. A solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
oath of abjuration of Pope Alexander
was enacted, and to some extent enforced;
it was to be taken by every male
under twelve years old throughout the
<span class="locked">realm.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> The King's officers compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
this act of obedience to the King, in
villages, in castles, in cities.</p>

<p>If the ambassadors of Henry at
Wurtzburg had full powers to transfer
the allegiance of the King to the Antipope;
if they took the oath unconditionally,
and with no reserve in case Alexander
should abandon the cause of
Becket; if this oath of abjuration in
England was generally administered;
it is clear that Henry soon changed, or
wavered at least in his policy. The
alliance between the two houses came
to nothing. Yet even after this he addressed
another letter to Reginald,
Archbishop of Cologne, declaring again
his long cherished determination to
abandon the cause of Alexander, the
supporter of his enemy, the Archbishop
of Canterbury. He demanded safe-conduct
for an embassy to Rome, the
Archbishop of York, the Bishop of London,
John of Oxford, De Luci, the Justiciary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
peremptorily to require the
Pope to annul all the acts of Thomas,
and to command the observance of the
<span class="locked">Customs.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> The success of Alexander in
Italy, aversion in England to the abjuration
of Alexander, some unaccounted
jealousy with the Emperor, irresolution
in Henry, which was part of his impetuous
character, may have wrought this
change.</p>

<p>The monk and severe student of Pontigny
found rest neither in his austerities
nor his <span class="locked">studies.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span> The causes of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
enforced repose are manifest&mdash;the negotiations
between Henry and the Emperor,
the uncertainty of the success of
the Pope on his return to Italy. It
would have been perilous policy, either
for him to risk, or for the Pope not to
inhibit any rash measure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket cites
the King.</div>

<p>In the second year of his seclusion,
when he found that the King's heart
was still hardened, the fire, not, we are
assured by his followers, of resentment,
but of parental love, not zeal for vengeance
but for justice, burned within
his soul. Henry was at this
time in France. Three times
the exile cited his sovereign with the
tone of a superior to submit to his censure.
Becket had communicated his
design to his followers:&mdash;"Let us act
as the Lord commanded his <span class="locked">steward:<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
'See, I have set thee over the nations,
and over the kingdoms, to root out and
to pull down, and to destroy, and to
hew down, to build and to <span class="locked">plant.'"<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span>
All his hearers applauded his righteous
resolution. In the first message the
haughty meaning was veiled in the
blandest <span class="locked">words,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> and sent by a Cistercian
of gentle demeanor, named <span class="locked">Urban.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span>
The King returned a short and
bitter answer. The second time Becket
wrote in severer language, but yet in
the spirit, 'tis said, of compassion and
<span class="locked">leniency.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> The King deigned no reply.
His third messenger was a tattered,
barefoot friar. To him Becket, it might
seem, with studied insult, not only intrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
his letter to the King, but authorized
the friar to speak in his name.
With such a messenger the message
was not likely to lose in asperity. The
King returned an answer even more
contemptuous than the <span class="locked">address.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 11, 1165.</div>

<p>But this secret arraignment of the
King did not content the unquiet prelate.
He could now dare
more, unrestrained, unrebuked. Pope
Alexander had been received at Rome
with open arms: at the commencement
of the present year all seemed to favor
his cause. The Emperor, detained by
wars in Germany, was not prepared to
cross the Alps. In the free cities of
Italy, the anti-imperialist feeling, and
the growing republicanism, gladly entered
into close confederacy with a Pope
at war with the Emperor. The Pontiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
(secretly it should seem, it might be
in defiance or in revenge for Henry's
threatened revolt and for the acts of his
ambassadors at <span class="locked">Wurtzburg<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span>) ventured
to grant to Becket a legatine power
over the King's English dominions,
except the province of York. Though
it was not in the power of Becket to
enter those dominions, it armed him,
as it was thought, with unquestionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
authority over Henry and his
subjects. At all events it annulled
whatever restraint the Pope, by counsel
or by mandate, had placed on the
proceedings of <span class="locked">Becket.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> The Archbishop
took his determination <span class="locked">alone.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span>
As though to throw an awful mystery
about his plan, he called his wise friends
together, and consulted them on the
propriety of resigning his see. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
one voice they rejected the timid counsel.
Yet though his most intimate followers
were in ignorance of his designs,
some intelligence of a meditated blow
was betrayed to Henry. The King
summoned an assembly of prelates at
Chinon. The Bishops of Lisieux and
Seez, whom the Archbishop of Rouen,
Rotran, consented to accompany as a
mediator, were dispatched to Pontigny,
to anticipate by an appeal to the Pope,
any sentence which might be pronounced
by Becket. They did not find him there:
he had already gone to Soissons, on the
pretext of a pilgrimage to the shrine
of St. Drausus, a saint whose intercession
rendered the warrior invincible in
battle. Did Becket hope thus to secure
victory in the great spiritual combat?
One whole night he passed before the
shrine of St. Drausus: another before
that of Gregory the Great, the founder
of the English Church, and of the see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of Canterbury; and a third before that
of the Virgin, his especial patroness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket at
Vezelay.</div>

<p>From thence he proceeded to the ancient
and famous monastery of <span class="locked">Vezelay.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span>
The church of Vezelay, if
the dismal decorations of the

of that period, might seem designated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>

the feast of the <span class="locked">Ascension,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> when the
church was crowded with worshipers
from all quarters, he ascended the pulpit,
and with the utmost solemnity, condemned
and annulled the Constitutions
of Clarendon, declared excommunicate
all who observed or enforced their observance,
all who had counseled, and
all who had defended them; absolved
all the bishops from the oaths which
they had taken to maintain them. This
sweeping anathema involved the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
kingdom. But he proceeded to excommunicate
by name the most active and
powerful adversaries: John of Oxford,
for his dealings with the schismatic
partisans of the Emperor and of the
Antipope, and for his usurpation of the
deanery of Salisbury; Richard of Ilchester
Archdeacon of Poitiers, the colleague
of John in his negotiations at
Wurtzburg (thus the cause of Becket
and Pope Alexander were indissolubly
welded together); the great Justiciary,
Richard de Luci, and John of Baliol, the
authors of the Constitutions of Clarendon;
Randulph de Broc, Hugo de Clare,
and others, for their forcible usurpation
of the estates of the see of Canterbury.
He yet in his mercy spared the King
(he had received intelligence that Henry
was dangerously ill), and in a lower
tone, his voice, as it seemed, half choked
with tears, he uttered his Commination.
The whole congregation, even his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
intimate followers, were silent with
amazement.</p>

<p>This sentence of excommunication
Becket announced to the Pope, and to
all the clergy of England. To the latter
he said, "Who presumes to doubt that
the priests of God are the fathers and
masters of kings, princes, and all the
faithful?" He commanded Gilbert,
Bishop of London, and his other suffragans,
to publish this edict throughout
their dioceses. He did not confine himself
to the bishops of England; the Norman
prelates, the Archbishop of Rouen,
were expressly warned to withdraw from
all communion with the <span class="locked">excommunicate.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span></p>

<p>The wrath of Henry drove him almost

Soon after, on the occasion of some discussion
about the King of Scotland, he
burst into a fit of passion, threw away
his cap, ungirt his belt, stripped off his
clothes, tore the silken coverlid from
his bed, and crouched down on the

to lose his feet; if a clerk, his eyes, and
suffer more shameful mutilation; a layman
was to be hanged; a leper to be
burned. A bishop who left the kingdom,
for fear of the interdict, was to
carry nothing with him but his staff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
All exiles were to return on pain of
losing their benefices. Priests who refused
to chant the service were to be
mutilated, and all rebels to forfeit their
lands. An oath was to be administered
by the sheriffs to all adults, that
they would respect no ecclesiastical
censure from the Archbishop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket
driven from
Pontigny.</div>

<p>A second time Henry's ungovernable
passion betrayed him into a step which,
instead of lowering, only placed his
antagonist in a more formidable position.
He determined to drive him from
his retreat at Pontigny. He sent word
to the general of the Cistercian
order that it was at their peril,
if they harbored a traitor to his throne.
The Cistercians possessed many rich
abbeys in England; they dared not
defy at once the King's resentment
and rapacity. It was intimated to the
Abbot of Pontigny, that he must dismiss
his guest. The Abbot courteously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
communicated to Becket the danger
incurred by the Order. He could not
but withdraw; but instead now of lurking
in a remote monastery, in some
degree secluded from the public gaze,
he was received in the archiepiscopal
city of Sens; his honorable residence
was prepared in a monastery close to
the city; he lived in ostentatious
communication with the Archbishop
William, one of his most zealous <span class="locked">partisans.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Controversy
with English
clergy.</div>

<p>But the fury of haughtiness in Becket
equaled the fury of resentment in the
King: yet it was not without subtlety.
Just before the scene at Vezelay, it has
been said, the King had sent the Archbishop
of Rouen and the Bishop of
Lisieux to Pontigny, to lodge his appeal
to the Pope. Becket, duly informed
by his emissaries at the court, had taken
care to be absent. He eluded likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the personal service of the appeal of the
English clergy. An active and violent
correspondence ensued. The remonstrance,
purporting to be from
the Primate's suffragans and
the whole clergy of England, was not
without dignified calmness. With
covert irony, indeed, they said that they
had derived great consolation from the
hope that, when abroad, he would cease
to rebel against the King and the peace
of the realm; that he would devote his
days to study and prayer, and redeem
his lost time by fasting, watching, and
weeping; they reproached him with
the former favors of the King, with the
design of estranging the King from
Pope Alexander; they asserted the
readiness of the King to do full justice,
and concluded by lodging an appeal
until the Ascension-day of the following
<span class="locked">year.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> Foliot was no doubt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
author of this remonstrance, and between
the Primate and the Bishop of
London broke out a fierce warfare of
letters. With Foliot Becket kept no
terms. "You complain that the Bishop
of Salisbury has been excommunicated,
without citation, without hearing, without
judgment. Remember the fate of
Ucalegon. He trembled when his
neighbor's house was on fire." To
Foliot he asserted the pre-eminence, the
supremacy, the divinity of the spiritual
power without reserve. "Let not your
liege lord be ashamed to defer to those
to whom God himself defers, and calls
them <span class="locked">'Gods.'"<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> Foliot replied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
what may be received as the manifesto
of his party, and as the manifesto of a
party to be received with some mistrust,
yet singularly curious, as showing the
tone of defence taken by the opponents
of the Primate among the English
<span class="locked">clergy.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span></p>

<p>The address of the English prelates to
Pope Alexander was more moderate,
and drawn with great ability. It asserted
the justice, the obedience to the
Church, the great virtue and (a bold
assertion!) the conjugal fidelity of the
King. The King had at once obeyed
the citation of the Bishops of London
and Salisbury, concerning some encroachments
on the Church condemned
by the Pope. The sole design of Henry
had been to promote good morals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to maintain the peace of the realm.
That peace had been restored. All
resentments had died away, when
Becket fiercely recommenced the strife;
in sad and terrible letters had threatened
the King with excommunication, the
realm with interdict. He had suspended
the Bishop of Salisbury without trial.
"This was the whole of the cruelty,
perversity, malignity of the King
against the Church, declaimed on and
bruited abroad throughout the <span class="locked">world."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">John of
Oxford
at Rome.</div>

<p>The indefatigable John of Oxford was
in Rome, perhaps the bearer of this address.
Becket wrote to the Pope, insisting
on all the cruelties of the King; he
calls him a malignant tyrant, one
full of all malice. He dwelt
especially on the imprisonment of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of his chaplains, for which violation of
the sacred person of a clerk, the King
was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i> excommunicate. "Christ
was crucified anew in <span class="locked">Becket."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span> He
complained of the presumption of Foliot,
who had usurped the power of <span class="locked">primate;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span>
warned the Pope against the
wiles of John of Oxford; deprecated the
legatine mission, of which he had already
heard a rumor, of William of Pavia.
And all these letters, so unsparing to
the King, or copies of them, probably
bought out of the Roman chancery,
were regularly transmitted to the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
John of Oxford began his mission at
Rome by swearing undauntedly, that
nothing had been done at Wurtzburg
against the power of the Church or the
interests of Pope <span class="locked">Alexander.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> He surrendered

the hands of the Pope, and received it
back <span class="locked">again.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span> John of Oxford was
armed with more powerful weapons
than perjury or submission, and the
times now favored the use of these more
irresistible arms. The Emperor Frederick
was levying, if he had not already
set in motion, that mighty army which
swept, during the next year, through
Italy, made him master of Rome, and
witnessed his coronation and the enthronement
of the <span class="locked">Antipope.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> Henry
had now, notwithstanding his suspicious&mdash;more
than suspicious&mdash;dealings with
the Emperor, returned to his allegiance
to Alexander. Vast sums of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
money were from this time expended
in strengthening the cause of the
Pope. The Guelfic cities of Italy received
them with greedy hands. By
the gold of the King of England, and of
the King of Sicily, the Frangipani and
the family of Peter Leonis were retained
in their fidelity to the Pope. Becket,
on the other hand, had powerful friends
in Rome, especially the Cardinal Hyacinth,
to whom he writes, that Henry
had boasted that in Rome everything
was venal. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Dec. 1166.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> It was, however,
not till a second embassy arrived, consisting
of John Cummin and Ralph
of Tamworth, that Alexander made
his great concession, the sign that he
was not yet extricated from his distress.
He appointed William of Pavia, and
Otho, Cardinal of St. Nicholas, his
legates in France, to decide the <span class="locked">cause.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Meantime all Becket's acts were suspended
by the papal authority. At the
same time the Pope wrote to Becket,
entreating him at this perilous time of
the Church to make all possible concessions,
and to dissemble, if necessary, for
the <span class="locked">present.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span></p>

<p>If John of Oxford boasted prematurely
of his triumph (on his return to England
he took ostentatious possession of
his deanery of <span class="locked">Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span>), and predicted
the utter ruin of Becket, his friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
especially the King of <span class="locked">France,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> were
in utter dismay at this change in the
papal policy. John, as Becket had
heard (and his emissaries were everywhere),
on his landing in England, had
met the Bishop of Hereford (one of the
wavering bishops), prepared to cross the
sea in obedience to Becket's citation.
To him, after some delay, John had exhibited
letters of the Pope, which sent
him back to his diocese. On the sight
of these same letters, the Bishop of
London had exclaimed in the fullness
of his joy, "Then our Thomas is no
longer archbishop!" "If this be true,"
adds Becket, "the Pope has given a
death-blow to the <span class="locked">Church."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span> To the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>

the two cardinals he writes, "The one
is weak and versatile, the other treacherous
and crafty." He looked to their
arrival with indignant apprehension.
They are open to bribes, and may be
perverted to any <span class="locked">injustice.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
John of Oxford had proclaimed that
the cardinals, William of Pavia, and
Otho, were invested in full powers to
pass judgment between the King and
the <span class="locked">Primate.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> But whether John of
Oxford had mistaken or exaggerated
their powers, or the Pope (no improbable
case, considering the change of
affairs in Italy) had thought fit afterwards
to modify or retract them, they
came rather as mediators than judges,
with orders to reconcile the contending
parties, rather than to decide on their
cause. The cardinals did not arrive in
France till the autumn of the <span class="locked">year.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Even before their arrival, first rumors,
then more certain intelligence had been
propagated throughout Christendom of
the terrible disaster which had befallen
the Emperor. Barbarossa's career of vengeance
and conquest had been
cut short. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><small>A. D.</small> 1167. Flight of Frederick.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The Pope a prisoner,

as usual, but in a far more fearful manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
had resented the invasion of the
city by the German army. A pestilence
had broken out, which in less
than a month made such havoc among
the soldiers, that they could scarcely
find room to bury the dead. The fever
seemed to choose its victims among the
higher clergy, the partisans of the Antipope;
of the princes and nobles, the
chief victims were the younger Duke
Guelf, Duke Frederick of Swabia, and
some others; of the bishops, those of
Prague, Ratisbon, Augsburg, Spires,
Verdun, Liege, Zeitz; and the arch-rebel
himself, the antipope-maker, Reginald
of <span class="locked">Cologne.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> Throughout Europe
the clergy on the side of Alexander
raised a cry of awful exultation; it was
God manifestly avenging himself on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the enemies of the Church; the new
Sennacherib (so he is called by Becket)
had been smitten in his pride; and the
example of this chastisement of Frederick
was a command to the Church to
resist to the last all rebels against her
power, to put forth her spiritual arms,
which God would as assuredly support
by the same or more signal wonders.
The defeat of Frederick was an admonition
to the Pope to lay bare the sword
of Peter, and smite on all <span class="locked">sides.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket
against the
legates.</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that Becket
so interpreted what he deemed
a sign from heaven. But even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
before the disaster was certainly known
he had determined to show no submission
to a judge so partial and so corrupt
as William of <span class="locked">Pavia.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span> That cardinal
had urged the Pope at Sens to accept
Becket's resignation of his see. Becket
would not deign to disguise his contempt.
He wrote a letter so full of violence
that John of <span class="locked">Salisbury,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> to whom
it was submitted, persuaded him to destroy
it. A second was little milder;
at length he was persuaded to take a
more moderate tone. Yet even then he
speaks of the "insolence of princes lifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
up their horn." To Cardinal Otho,
on the other hand, his language borders
on adulation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting
near
Gisors.</div>

<p>The cardinal Legates traveled in
slow state. They visited first
Becket at Sens, afterwards King
Henry at Rouen. At length a meeting
was agreed on to be held on the borders
of the French and English territory,
between Gisors and Trie. The proud
Becket was disturbed at being hastily
summoned, when he was unable to
muster a sufficient retinue of horsemen
to meet the Italian cardinals. The two
kings were there. Of Henry's prelates
the Archbishop of Rouen alone was
present at the first interview. Becket
was charged with urging the King of
France to war against his master. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Octave of St. Martin. Nov. 23.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> On
the following day the King of France
said in the presence of the cardinals,
that this impeachment on Becket's

the persuasions, menaces, entreaties of
the <span class="locked">cardinals<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> Becket declared that he
would submit, "saving the honor of
God, and of the Apostolic See, the liberty
of the Church, the dignity of his
person, and the property of the churches.
As to the Customs he declared that he
would rather bow his neck to the executioner
than swear to observe them.
He peremptorily demanded his own
restoration at once to all the honors
and possessions of his see." The third
question was on the appeal of the bishops.
Becket inveighed with bitterness
on their treachery towards him, their
servility to the King. "When the
shepherds fled all Egypt returned to
idolatry." Becket interpreted these
"shepherds" as the <span class="locked">clergy.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span> He compares
them to the slaves in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
comedy; he declared that he would
submit to no judgment on that point
but that of the Pope himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cardinals
before
the King.</div>

<p>The Cardinals proceeded to the King.
They were received but coldly
at Argences, not far from Caen,
at a great meeting with the Norman
and English prelates. The Bishop of
London entered at length into the
King's grievances and his own; Becket's
debt to the <span class="locked">King,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> his usurpations
on the see of London. At the close
Henry, in tears, entreated the cardinals
to rid him of the troublesome churchman.
William of Pavia wept, or seemed
to weep from sympathy. Otho,
writes Becket's emissary, could hardly
suppress his laughter. The English
prelates afterwards at Le Mans solemnly
renewed their appeal. Their appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was accompanied with a letter, in which
they complain that Becket would leave
them exposed to the wrath of the King,
from which wrath he himself had <span class="locked">fled;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span>
of false representations of the Customs,
and disregard of all justice and of the
sacred canons in suspending and anathematizing
the clergy without hearing
and without trial. William of Pavia
gave notice of the appeal for the next
St. Martin's Day (so a year was to
elapse), with command to abstain from
all excommunication and interdict of
the kingdom till that <span class="locked">day.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> Both cardinals

<div class="sidenote">Dec. 29.</div>

<p>At this suspension Becket wrote to
the Pope in a tone of mingled grief and
<span class="locked">indignation.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> He described himself as
the most wretched of men; applied the
prophetic description of the Saviour's
unequaled sorrow to himself. He inveighed
against William of <span class="locked">Pavia:<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span> he
threw himself on the justice and compassion
of the Pope. But this inhibition
was confirmed by the Pope himself,
in answer to another embassage of
Henry, consisting of Clarembold, Prior
elect of St. Augustine's, the Archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of Salisbury, and <span class="locked">others.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> This important
favor was obtained through the interest
of Cardinal John of Naples, who expresses
his hope that the insolent Archbishop
must at length see that he had
no resource but in submission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 19.
Becket to
the Pope.</div>

<p>Becket wrote again and again to the
Pope, bitterly complaining that
the successive ambassadors of
the King, John of Oxford, John Cummin,
the Prior of St. Augustine's, returned
from Rome each with larger
<span class="locked">concessions.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> The Pope acknowledged
that the concessions had been extorted
from him. The ambassadors of Henry
had threatened to leave the Papal Court,
if their demands were not complied
with, in open hostility. The Pope was
still an exile in <span class="locked">Benevento,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
not dare to reoccupy Rome. The Emperor,
even after his discomfiture, was
still formidable; he might collect another
overwhelming Transalpine force.
The subsidies of Henry to the Italian
cities and to the Roman partisans of
the Pope could not be spared. The
Pontiff therefore wrote soothing letters
to the King of France and to Becket.
He insinuated that these concessions
were but for a time. "For a
time!" replied Becket in an answer full
of fire and passion: "and in that time
the Church of England falls utterly to
ruin; the property of the Church and
the poor is wrested from her. In that
time prelacies and abbacies are confiscated
to the King's use: in that time
who will guard the flock when the wolf
is in the fold? This fatal dispensation
will be a precedent for all ages. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
for me and my fellow exiles all authority
of Rome had ceased forever in
England. There had been no one who
had maintained the Pope against kings
and princes." His significant language
involves the Pope himself in the general
and unsparing charge of rapacity
and venality with which he brands the
court of Rome. "I shall have to give
an account at the last day, where gold

hand, the King and the Queen of
France wrote in a tone of indignant remonstrance
that the Pope had abandoned
the cause of the enemy of their
enemy. More than one of the French
prelates who wrote in the same strain
declared that their King, in his resentment,
had seriously thought of defection
to the Antipope, and of a close connexion
with the Imperial <span class="locked">family.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> Alexander
determined to make another attempt
at reconciliation; at least he
should gain time, that precious source
of hope to the embarrassed and irresolute.
His mediators were the Prior of
Montdieu and Bernard de Corilo, a
monk of <span class="locked">Grammont.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> It was a fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
time, for just at this juncture,
peace and even amity seemed to be established
between the Kings of France
and England. Many of the great Norman
and French prelates and nobles
offered themselves as joint mediators
with the commissioners of the Pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting
at Montmirail.</div>

<p>A vast assembly was convened on the
day of the Epiphany in the plains
near Montmirail, where in the
presence of the two kings and the barons
of each realm the reconciliation was to
take place. Becket held a long conference
with the mediators. He proposed,
instead of the obnoxious phrase
"saving my order," to substitute "saving
the honor of <span class="locked">God;"<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> the mediators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the treaty insisted on his throwing
himself on the King's mercy absolutely
and without reservation. With great
reluctance Becket appeared at least to
yield: his counselors acquiesced in
silence. With this distinct understanding
the Kings of France and England
met at Montmirail, and everything
seemed prepared for the final settlement
of this long and obstinate quarrel. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Jan. 6, 1169.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The Kings awaited the approach
of the Primate. But as he was on his
way, De Bosham (who always assumes
to himself the credit of suggesting
Becket's most haughty proceedings)
whispered in his ear (De Bosham himself
asserts this) a solemn caution, lest
he should act over again the fatal scene
of weakness at Clarendon. Becket had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
not time to answer De Bosham: he advanced
to the King and threw himself
at his feet. Henry raised him instantly
from the ground. Becket, standing upright,
began to solicit the clemency of
the King. He declared his readiness
to submit his whole cause to the judgment
of the two Kings and of the assembled
prelates and nobles. After a
pause he added, "Saving the honor of
<span class="locked">God."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Treaty
broken off.</div>

<p>At this unexpected breach of his
agreement the mediators, even the most
ardent admirers of Becket, stood aghast.
Henry, thinking himself duped,
as well he might, broke out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
one of his ungovernable fits of anger.
He reproached the Archbishop with
arrogance, obstinacy, and ingratitude.
He so far forgot himself as to declare
that Becket had displayed all his magnificence
and prodigality as chancellor
only to court popularity and to supplant
his king in the affections of his people.
Becket listened with patience, and appealed
to the King of France as witness
to his loyalty. Henry fiercely interrupted
him. "Mark, Sire (he addressed
the King of France), the infatuation
and pride of the man: he pretends to
have been banished, though he fled
from his see. He would persuade you
that he is maintaining the cause of the
Church, and suffering for the sake of
justice. I have always been willing,
and am still willing, to grant that he
should rule his Church with the same
liberty as his predecessors, men not less
holy than himself." Even the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
France seemed shocked at the conduct
of Becket. The prelates and nobles,
having in vain labored to bend the inflexible
spirit of the Primate, retired in
sullen dissatisfaction. He stood alone.
Even John of Poitiers, his most ardent
admirer, followed him to Etampes, and
entreated him to yield. "And you,
too," returned Becket, "will you strangle
us, and give triumph to the malignity
of our <span class="locked">enemies?"<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span></p>

<p>The King of England retired, followed
by the Papal Legates, who, though
they held letters of Commination from
the <span class="locked">Pope,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span> delayed to serve them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the King. Becket followed the King
of France to Montmirail. He was received
by Louis; and Becket put on
so cheerful a countenance as to surprise
all present. On his return to Sens, he
explained to his followers that his cause
was not only that of the Church, but of
<span class="locked">God.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> He passed among the acclamations
of the populace, ignorant of his
duplicity. "Behold the prelate who
stood up even before two kings for the
honor of God."</p>

<div class="sidenote">War of
France and
England.</div>

<p>Becket may have had foresight, or
even secret information of the hollowness
of the peace between the two kings.
Before many days, some acts of barbarous
cruelty by Henry against
his rebellious subjects plunged
the two nations again in hostility. The
King of France and his prelates, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
how nearly they had lost their powerful
ally, began to admire what they called
Becket's magnanimity as loudly as they
had censured his obstinacy. The King
visited him at Sens: one of the Papal
commissioners, the Monk of Grammont,
said privately to Herbert de Bosham,
that he had rather his foot had been cut
off than that Becket should have listened
to his <span class="locked">advice.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Excommunication.</div>

<p>Becket now at once drew the sword
and cast away the scabbard. "Cursed
is he that refraineth his sword from
blood." This Becket applied to the
spiritual weapon. On Ascension Day
he again solemnly excommunicated
Gilbert Foliot Bishop of
London, Joscelin of Salisbury, the Archdeacon
of Salisbury, Richard de Luci,
Randulph de Broc, and many other of
Henry's most faithful counselors. He
announced this excommunication to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Archbishop of <span class="locked">Rouen,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span> and reminded
him that whosoever presumed to communicate
with any one of these outlaws
of the Church by word, in meat or
drink, or even by salutation, subjected
himself thereby to the same excommunication.
The appeal to the Pope he
treated with sovereign contempt. He
sternly inhibited Roger of Worcester,
who had entreated permission to communicate
with his <span class="locked">brethren.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> "What
fellowship is there between Christ and
Belial?" He announced this act to the
Pope, entreating, but with the tone of
command, his approbation of the proceeding.
An emissary of Becket had
the boldness to enter St. Paul's Cathedral
in London, to thrust the sentence
into the hands of the officiating priest,
and then to proclaim with a loud voice,
"Know all men, that Gilbert Bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
London is excommunicate by Thomas
Archbishop of Canterbury and Legate
of the Pope." He escaped with some
difficulty from ill-usage by the people.
Foliot immediately summoned his
clergy; explained the illegality, injustice,
nullity of an excommunication
without citation, hearing, or trial, and
renewed his appeal to the Pope. The
Dean of St. Paul's and all the clergy,
excepting the priests of certain monasteries,
joined in the appeal. The Bishop
of Exeter declined, nevertheless he gave
to Foliot the kiss of <span class="locked">peace.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry's
intrigues
in Italy.</div>

<p>King Henry was not without fear at
this last desperate blow. He
had not a single chaplain who
had not been excommunicated, or was
not virtually under ban for holding
intercourse with persons under <span class="locked">excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span>
He continued his active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
intrigues, his subsidies in Italy. He
bought the support of Milan, Pavia,
Cremona, Parma, Bologna. The Frangipani,
the family of Leo, the people of
Rome, were still kept in allegiance to
the Pope chiefly by his lavish <span class="locked">payments.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span>
He made overtures to the
King of Sicily, the Pope's ally, for a
matrimonial alliance with his family:
and finally, he urged the tempting offer
to mediate a peace between the Emperor
and the Pope. Reginald of Salisbury
boasted that, if the Pope should
die, Henry had the whole College of
Cardinals in his pay, and could name
his <span class="locked">Pope.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">New Legatine
Commission.
Mar. 10, 1169.</div>

<p>But no longer dependent on Henry's
largesses to his partisans, Alexander's
affairs wore a more prosperous aspect.
He began, yet cautiously, to show his
real bias. He determined to appoint a
new legatine commission, not
now rapacious cardinals and
avowed partisans of Henry. The Nuncios
were Gratian, a hard and severe
canon lawyer, not likely to swerve from
the loftiest claims of the Decretals; and
Vivian, a man of more pliant character,
but as far as he was firm in any principle,
disposed to high ecclesiastical views.
At the same time he urged Becket to
issue no sentences against the King or
the King's followers; or if, as he hardly
believed, he had already done so, to
suspend their powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English prelates
waver.</div>

<p>The terrors of the excommunication
were not without their effect
in England. Some of the Bishops
began gradually to recede from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
King's party, and to incline to that of
the Primate. Hereford had already
attempted to cross the sea. Henry of
Winchester was in private correspondence
with Becket: he had throughout
secretly supplied him with <span class="locked">money.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span>
Becket skillfully labored to awaken his
old spirit of opposition to the Crown.
He reminded Winchester of his royal
descent, that he was secure in his powerful
connexions; "the impious one
would not dare to strike him, for fear
lest his kindred should avenge his
<span class="locked">cause."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span> Norwich, Worcester, Chester,
even Chichester, more than wavered.
This movement was strengthened by a
false step of Foliot, which exposed all
his former proceedings to the charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of irregular ambition. He began to
declare publicly not only that he never
swore canonical obedience to Becket,
but to assert the independence of the
see of London and the right of the see
of London to the primacy of England.
Becket speaks of this as an act of spiritual
parricide: Foliot was another <span class="locked">Absalom.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span>
He appealed to the pride and
the fears of the Chapter of Canterbury:
he exposed, and called on them to resist,
these machinations of Foliot to degrade
the archiepiscopal see. At the same
time he warned all persons to abstain
from communion with those who were
under his ban; "for he had accurate
information as to all who were guilty
of that offence." Even in France this
proceeding strengthened the sympathy
with Becket. The Archbishop of Sens,
the Bishops of Troyes, Paris, Noyon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Auxerre, Boulogne, wrote to the Pope
to denounce this audacious impiety of
the Bishop of London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interview
of the new
Legates with
the King.
Aug. 23.</div>

<p>The first interview of the new Papal
legates, Gratian and Vivian,
with the King, is described
with singular minuteness by a
friend of <span class="locked">Becket.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> On the eve of St. Bartholomew's
Day they arrived at Damport.
On their approach, Geoffrey Ridel
and Nigel Sackville stole out of the town.
The King, as he came in from hunting,
courteously stopped at the lodging of
the Legates: as they were conversing
the Prince rode up with a great blowing
of horns from the chase, and presented
a whole stag to the Legates.
The next morning the King visited
them, accompanied by the Bishops of
Seez and of Rennes. Presently John
of Oxford, Reginald of Salisbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and the Archdeacon of Llandaff were
admitted. The conference lasted the
whole day, sometimes in amity, sometimes
in strife. Just before sunset the
King rushed out in wrath, swearing by
the eyes of God that he would not submit
to their terms. Gratian firmly replied,
"Think not to threaten us; we
come from a court which is accustomed
to command Emperors and Kings."
The King then summoned his barons
to witness, together with his chaplains,
what fair offers he had made. He departed
somewhat pacified. The eighth
day was appointed for the convention,
at which the King and the Archbishop
were again to meet in the presence of
the Legates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 31.</div>

<p>It was held at Bayeux. With the
King appeared the Archbishops
of Rouen and Bordeaux, the Bishop of
Le Mans, and all the Norman prelates.
The second day arrived one English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
bishop&mdash;Worcester. John of Poitiers
kept prudently away. The Legates
presented the Pope's preceding letters
in favor of Becket. The King, after
stating his <span class="locked">grievances,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> said, "If for
this man I do anything, on account of
the Pope's entreaties, he ought to be
very grateful." The next day at a
place called Le Bar, the King requested
the Legates to absolve his chaplains
without any oath: on their refusal, the
King mounted his horse, and swore that
he would never listen to the Pope or
any one else concerning the restoration
of Becket. The prelates interceded;
the Legates partially gave way. The
King dismounted and renewed the conference.
At length he consented to the
return of Becket and all the exiles. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
seemed delighted at this, and treated of
other affairs. He returned again to the
Legates, and demanded that they, or
one of them, or at least some one commissioned
by them, should cross over
to England to absolve all who had been
excommunicated by the Primate. Gratian
refused this with inflexible obstinacy.
The King was again furious: "I care
not an egg for you and your excommunications."
He again mounted his
horse, but at the earnest supplication
of the prelates he returned once more.
He demanded that they should write
to the Pope to announce his pacific
offers. The Bishops explained to the
King that the Legates had at last produced
a positive mandate of the Pope,
enjoining their absolute obedience to
his Legates. The King replied, "I
know that they will lay my realm under
an interdict, but cannot I, who can take
the strongest castle in a day, seize any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ecclesiastic who shall presume to utter
such an interdict?" Some concessions
allayed his wrath, and he returned to his
offers of reconciliation. Geoffry Ridel
and Nigel Sackville were absolved
on the condition of declaring, with
their hands on the Gospels, that they
would obey the commands of the Legates.
The King still pressing the visit
of one of the Legates to England, Vivian
consented to take the journey. The
bishops were ordered to draw up the
treaty; but the King insisted on a
clause "Saving the honor of his Crown."
They adjourned to a future day at
Caen. The Bishop of Lisieux, adds
the writer, flattered the King; the Archbishop
of Rouen was for God and the
Pope.</p>

<p>Two conferences at Caen and at Rouen
were equally inconclusive; the King
insisted on the words, "saving the dignity
of my Crown." Becket inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
if he might add "saving the liberty of
the <span class="locked">Church."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span></p>

<p>The King threw all the blame of the
final rupture on the Legates, who had
agreed, he said, to this <span class="locked">clause,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> but
through Becket's influence withdrew
from their <span class="locked">word.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span> He reminded the
Pope that he had in his possession letters
of his Holiness exempting him and
his realm from all authority of the Primate
till he should be received into the
royal <span class="locked">favor.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> "If," he adds, "the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
refuses my demands, he must henceforth
despair of my good will, and look
to other quarters to protect his realm
and his honor." Both parties renewed
their appeals, their intrigues in Rome;
Becket's complaints of Rome's venality
became <span class="locked">louder.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span></p>

<p>Becket began again to fulminate his
excommunications. Before his departure
Gratian signified to Geoffry Ridel
and Nigel Sackville that their absolution
was conditional; if peace was not
ratified by Michaelmas, they were still
under the ban. Becket menaced some
old, some new victims, the Dean of
Salisbury, John Cummin, the Archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of Llandaff, and <span class="locked">others.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span> But
he now took a more decisive and terrible
step. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Nov. 2, 1170.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> He wrote to the bishops of
<span class="locked">England,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> commanding them to lay
the whole kingdom under interdict; all
divine offices were to cease except baptism,
penance, and the viaticum, unless
before the Feast of the Purification
the King should have given full
satisfaction for his contumacy to the
Church. This was to be done with
closed doors, the laity expelled from
the ceremony, with no bell tolling, no
dirge wailing; all church music was to
cease. The act was specially announced
to the chapters of Chichester, Lincoln,
and Bath. Of the Pope he demanded
that he would treat the King's ambassadors,
Reginald of Salisbury and
Richard Barre, one as actually excommunicate,
the other as contaminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
by intercourse with the <span class="locked">excommunicate.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span></p>

<p>The menace of the Interdict, with the
fear that the Bishops of England, all
but London and Salisbury, might be
overawed into publishing it in their
dioceses, threw Henry back into his
usual irresolution. There were other
alarming signs. Gratian had returned
to Rome, accompanied by William,
Archbishop of Sens, Becket's most faithful
admirer. Rumors spread that William
was to return invested in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
legatine powers&mdash;William, not only
Becket's friend, but the head of the
French hierarchy. If the Interdict
should be extended to his French dominions,
and the Excommunication launched
against his person, could he depend
on the precarious fidelity of the Norman
prelates? Differences had again arisen
with the King of <span class="locked">France.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> Henry was
seized with an access of devotion. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Henry at Paris.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> He asked permission to offer his
prayers at the shrines and at the Martyrs'
Mount (Montmartre) at Paris.
The pilgrimage would lead to an interview
with the King of France, and offer
an occasion of renewing the negotiations
with Becket. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Nov. 1169.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Vivan was hastily
summoned to turn back. His vanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was flattered by the hope of
achieving that reconciliation which had
failed with Gratian. He wrote to
Becket requesting his presence. Becket,
though he suspected Vivian, yet out of
respect to the King of France, consented
to approach as near as Château Corbeil.
After the conference with the
King of France, two petitions from
Becket, in his usual tone of imperious
humility, were presented to the King of
England. The Primate condescended
to entreat the favor of Henry, and the
restoration of the Church of Canterbury,
in as ample a form as it was held before
his exile. The second was more brief,
but raised a new question of compensation
for loss and damage during the
archbishop's absence from his
<span class="locked">see.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Negotiations renewed.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Both parties mistrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
each other; each watched the other's
words with captious jealousy. Vivian,
weary of those verbal chicaneries of
the King, declared that he had never
met with so mendacious a man in his
<span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span> Vivian might have remembered
his own retractations, still more those of
Becket on former occasions. He withdrew
from the negotiation; and this
conduct, with the refusal of a gift from
Henry (a rare act of virtue), won him
the approbation of Becket. But Becket
himself was not yet without mistrust;
he had doubts whether Vivian's report
to the Pope would be in the same spirit.
"If it be not, he deserves the doom of
the traitor Judas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Henry at length, agreed that on the
question of compensation he would
abide by the sentence of the court of
the French King, the judgment of the
Gallican Church, and of the University
of <span class="locked">Paris.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span> This made so favorable an
impression that Becket could only
evade it by declaring that he had rather
come to an amicable agreement with
the King than involve the affair in
litigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kiss of
peace.</div>

<p>At length all difficulties seemed yielding
away, when Becket demanded
the customary kiss of peace, as the
pledge of reconciliation. Henry peremptorily
refused; he had sworn in his
wrath never to grant this favor to
Becket. He was inexorable; and without
this guarantee Becket would not
trust the faith of the King. He was
reminded, he said, by the case of the
Count of Flanders, that even the kiss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
peace did not secure a revolted subject,
Robert de Silian, who, even after this
sign of amity, had been seized and cast
into a dungeon. Henry's conduct, if
not the effect of sudden passion or ungovernable
aversion, is inexplicable.
Why did he seek this interview, which,
if he was insincere in his desire for reconciliation,
could afford but short
delay? and from such oaths he would
hardly have refused, for any great purpose
of his own, to receive <span class="locked">absolution.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span>
On the other hand, it is quite clear that
Becket reckoned on the legatine power
of William of Sens and the terror of the
English prelates, who had refused to
attend a council in London to reject
the Interdict. He had now full confidence
that he could exact his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
terms and humble the King under his
<span class="locked">feet.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">King's proclamation.</div>

<p>But the King was resolved to wage
war to the utmost. Geoffry Ridel,
Archdeacon of Canterbury, was
sent to England with a royal
proclamation containing the following
articles:&mdash;I. Whosoever shall bring
into the realm any letter from the Pope
or the Archbishop of Canterbury is
guilty of high treason. II. Whosoever,
whether bishop, clerk, or layman, shall
observe the Interdict, shall be ejected
from all his chattels, which are confiscate
to the Crown. III. All clerks
absent from England shall return before
the feast of St. Hilary, on pain of
forfeiture of all their revenues. IV.
No appeal is to be made to the Pope or
Archbishop of Canterbury under pain
of imprisonment and forfeiture of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
chattels. V. All laymen from beyond
seas are to be searched, and if anything
be found upon them contrary to the
King's honor, they are to be imprisoned;
the same with those who cross to
the Continent. VI. If any clerk or
monk shall land in England without
passport from the King, or with anything
contrary to his honor, he shall be
thrown into prison. VII. No clerk or
monk may cross the seas without the
King's passport. The same rule applied
to the clergy of Wales, who were to be
expelled from all schools in England.
Lastly, VIII. The sheriffs were to administer
an oath to all freemen throughout
England, in open court, that they
would obey these royal mandates, thus
abjuring, it is said, all obedience to
Thomas, Archbishop of <span class="locked">Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
The bishops, however, declined the
oath; some concealed themselves in
their dioceses. Becket addressed a triumphant
or gratulatory letter to his
suffragans on their firmness. "We are
now one, except that most hapless
Judas, that rotten limb (Foliot of London),
which is severed from <span class="locked">us."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span> Another
letter is addressed to the people of
England, remonstrating on their impious
abjuration of their pastor, and offering
absolution to all who had sworn through
compulsion and repented of their <span class="locked">oath.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span>
The King and the Primate thus contested
the realm of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pope
still dubious.</div>

<p>But the Pope was not yet to be inflamed
by Becket's passions,
nor quite disposed to depart
from his temporizing policy. John of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Oxford was at the court in Benevento
with the Archdeacons of Rouen and
Seez. From that court returned the
Archdeacon of Llandaff and Robert de
Barre with a commission to the Archbishop
of Rouen and the Bishop of
Nevers to make one more effort for the
termination of the difficulties. On the
one hand they were armed with powers,
if the King did not accede to his own
terms within forty days after his citation
(he had offered a thousand marks as
compensation for all losses), to pronounce
an interdict against his continental
dominions; on the other, Becket
was exhorted to humble himself before
the King; if Henry was inflexible and
declined the Pope's offered absolution
from his oath, to accept the kiss of
peace from the King's son. The King
was urged to abolish in due time the
impious and obnoxious Customs. And
to these prelates was likewise intrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
authority to absolve the refractory
Bishops of London and <span class="locked">Salisbury.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span>
This, however, was not the only object
of Henry's new embassy to the Pope.
He had long determined on the coronation
of his eldest son; it had been
delayed for various reasons. He seized
this opportunity of reviving a design
which would be as well humiliating to
Becket as also of great moment in case
the person of the King should be struck
by the thunder of excommunication.
The coronation of the King of England
was the undoubted prerogative of the
Archbishops of Canterbury, which had
never been invaded without sufficient
cause, and Becket was the last man
tamely to surrender so important a right
of his see. John of Oxford was to
exert every means (what those means
were may be conjectured rather than
proved) to obtain the papal permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
for the Archbishop of York to officiate
at that august ceremony.</p>

<p>The absolution of the Bishops of London
and Salisbury was an astounding
blow to Becket. He tried to impede it
by calling in question the power of the
archbishop to pronounce it without the
presence of his colleague. The archbishop
disregarded his remonstrance,
and Becket's sentence was thus annulled
by the authority of the Pope. Rumors
at the same time began to spread that
the Pope had granted to the Archbishop
of York power to proceed to the
coronation. Becket's fury burst all
bounds. He wrote to the Cardinal
Albert and to Gratian: "In the court
of Rome, now as ever, Christ is crucified
and Barabbas released. The miserable
and blameless exiles are condemned,
the sacrilegious, the homicides, the
impenitent thieves are absolved, those
whom Peter himself declares that in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
own chair (the world protesting against
it) he would have no power to <span class="locked">absolve.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span>
Henceforth I commit my cause to God&mdash;God
alone can find a remedy. Let
those appeal to Rome who triumph
over the innocent and the godly, and
return glorying in the ruin of the
Church. For me I am ready to die."
Becket's fellow exiles addressed the
Cardinal Albert, denouncing in vehement
language the avarice of the court
of Rome, by which they were brought
to support the robbers of the Church.
It is no longer King Henry alone who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
is guilty of this six years' persecution,
but the Church of <span class="locked">Rome.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span></p>

<p>The coronation of the Prince by the
Archbishop of York took place in the
Abbey of Westminster on the 15th
of <span class="locked">June.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span> The assent of the clergy was
given with that of the laity. The Archbishop
of York produced a papal brief,
authorising him to perform the <span class="locked">ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span>
An inhibitory letter, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
reached England, only came into the
King's hand, and was suppressed; no
one, in fact (as the production of such
papal letter, as well as Becket's protest
to the archbishop and to the bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
collectively and severally, was by the
royal proclamation high treason or at
least a misdemeanor) would dare to
produce them.</p>

<p>The estrangement seemed now complete,
the reconciliation more remote
than ever. The Archbishop of Rouen
and the Bishop of Nevers, though urged
to immediate action by Becket and even
by the Pope, admitted delay after delay,
first for the voyage of the King to England,
and secondly for his return to
Normandy. Becket seemed more and
more desperate, the King more and more
resolute. Even after the coronation, it
should seem, Becket wrote to Roger of
<span class="locked">York,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span> to Henry of Worcester, and
even to Foliot of London, to publish
the Interdict in their dioceses. The
latter was a virtual acknowledgment of
the legality of his absolution, which in
a long letter to the Bishop of Nevers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he had <span class="locked">contested:<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> but the Interdict
still hung over the King and the realm;
the fidelity of the clergy was precarious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treaty of
Fretteville.</div>

<p>The reconciliation at last was so sudden
as to take the world by surprise.
The clue to this is found in Fitz-Stephen.
Some one had suggested by word or by
writing to the King that the Primate
would be less dangerous within than
without the <span class="locked">realm.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span> The hint flashed
conviction on the King's mind. The
two Kings had appointed an interview
at Fretteville, between Chartres and
Tours. The Archbishop of Sens
prevailed on Becket to be, unsummoned,
in the neighborhood. Some
days after the King seemed persuaded
by the Archbishops of Sens and Rouen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and the Bishop of Nevers to hold a conference
with <span class="locked">Becket.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span> As soon as they
drew near the King rode up, uncovered
his head, and saluted the Prelate with
frank courtesy, and after a short conversation
between the two and the
Archbishop of Sens, the King withdrew
apart with Becket. Their conference
was so long as to try the patience of
the spectators, so familiar that it might
seem there had never been discord between
them. Becket took a moderate
tone; by his own account he laid the
faults of the King entirely on his evil
counselors. After a gentle admonition
to the King on his sins, he urged him
to make restitution to the see of Canterbury.
He dwelt strongly on the
late usurpation on the rights of the primacy,
on the coronation of the King's
son. Henry alleged the state of the
kingdom and the necessity of the measure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
he promised that as his son's
queen, the daughter of the King of
France, was also to be crowned, that
ceremony should be performed by
Becket, and that his son should again
receive his crown from the hands of the
Primate.</p>

<p>At the close of the interview Becket
sprung from his horse and threw himself
at the King's feet. The King leaped
down, and holding his stirrup compelled
the Primate to mount his horse
again. In the most friendly terms he
expressed his full reconciliation not
only to Becket himself, but to the
wondering and delighted multitude.
There seemed an understanding on both
sides to suppress all points which might
lead to disagreement. The King did
not dare (so Becket writes triumphantly
to the Pope) to mutter one word about
the <span class="locked">Customs.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span> Becket was equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
prudent, though he took care that his
submission should be so vaguely worded
as to be drawn into no dangerous
concession on his part. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>July.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> He abstained,
too, from all other perilous topics; he
left undecided the amount of satisfaction
to the church of Canterbury; and
on these general terms he and the
partners of his exile were formally received
into the King's grace.
If the King was humiliated by this
quiet and sudden reconcilement with
the imperious prelate, to outward appearance
at least he concealed his humiliation
by his noble and kingly manner.
If he submitted to the spiritual reproof
of the prelate, he condescended to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
into his favor his refractory subject.
Each maintained prudent silence
on all points in dispute. Henry received,
but he also granted pardon. If his
concession was really extorted by fear,
not from policy, compassion for Becket's
six years' exile might seem not without
influence. If Henry did not allude to
the Customs, he did not annul them;
they were still the law of the land. The
kiss of peace was eluded by a vague
promise. Becket made a merit of not
driving the King to perjury, but he
skillfully avoided this trying test of the
King's sincerity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket's
schemes of
vengeance.</div>

<p>But Becket's revenge must be satisfied
with other victims. If the
worldly King could forget the
rancor of this long animosity, it was
not so easily appeased in the breast of
the Christian Prelate. No doubt vengeance
disguised itself to Becket's mind
as the lofty and rightful assertion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
spiritual authority. The opposing prelates
must be at his feet, even under his
feet. The first thought of his partisans
was not his return to England with a generous
amnesty of all wrongs, or a gentle
reconciliation of the whole clergy, but
the condign punishment of those who
had so long been the counselors of the
King, and had so recently officiated in
the coronation of his son.</p>

<p>The court of Rome did not refuse to
enter into these views, to visit the
offence of those disloyal bishops who
had betrayed the interests and compromised
the high principles of <span class="locked">churchmen.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span>
It was presumed that the King
would not risk a peace so hardly gained
for his obsequious prelates. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Dated Sept. 10.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The lay
adherents of the King, even the plunderers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of Church property were spared,
some ecclesiastics about his person,
John of Oxford himself escaped
censure: but Pope Alexander
sent the decree of suspension against
the Archbishop of York, and renewed
the excommunication of London and
Salisbury, with whom were joined the
Archdeacon of Canterbury and the
Bishop of Rochester, as guilty of special
violation of their allegiance to the Archbishop
of Canterbury, the Bishop of St.
Asaph, and some others. Becket himself
saw the policy of altogether separating
the cause of the bishops from that
of the King. He requested that some
expressions relating to the King's excesses,
and condemnatory of the bishops
for swearing to the Customs, should be
suppressed; and the excommunication
grounded entirely on their usurpation
of the right of crowning the <span class="locked">King.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Interview
at Tours.</div>

<p>About four months elapsed between
the treaty of Fretteville and the return
of Becket to England. They were occupied
by these negotiations at Rome,
Veroli, and Ferentino; by discussions
with the King, who was attacked during
this period with a dangerous illness;
and by the mission of some of Becket's
officers to resume the estates of the see.
Becket had two personal interviews
with the King: the first
was at Tours, where, as he was now in
the King's dominions, he endeavored
to obtain the kiss of peace. The Archbishop
hoped to betray Henry into this
favor during the celebration of the mass,
in which it might seem only a part of
the <span class="locked">service.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> Henry was on his guard,
and ordered the mass for the dead, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
which the benediction is not pronounced.
The King had received Becket fairly;
they parted not without ill-concealed
estrangement. At the second meeting
the King seemed more friendly; he went
so far as to say, "Why resist my wishes?
I would place everything in your hands."
Becket, in his own words, bethought
him of the tempter, "All these things
will I give unto thee, if thou wilt fall
down and worship me."</p>

<p>The King had written to his son in
England that the see of Canterbury
should be restored to Becket, as it was
three months before his exile. But
there were two strong parties hostile to
Becket: the King's officers who held in
sequestration the estates of the see, and
seem to have especially coveted the receipt
of the Michaelmas rents; and with
these some of the fierce warrior nobles,
who held lands or castles which were
claimed as possessions of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of Canterbury. Randulph De Broc,
his old inveterate enemy, was determined
not to surrender his castle of
Saltwood. It was reported to Becket,
by Becket represented to the King, that
De Broc had sworn that he would have
Becket's life before he had eaten a loaf
of bread in England. The castle of Rochester
was held on the same doubtful
title by one of his enemies. The second
party was that of the bishops, which
was powerful, with a considerable body
of the clergy and laity. They had sufficient
influence to urge the King's officers
to take the strongest measures, lest
the Papal letters of excommunication
should be introduced into the kingdom.</p>

<p>It is perhaps vain to conjecture, how
far, if Becket had returned to England
in the spirit of meekness, forgiveness,
and forbearance, not wielding the thunders
of excommunication, nor determined
to trample on his adversaries, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
exact the utmost even of his doubtful
rights, he might have resumed his see,
and gradually won back the favor of
the King, the respect and love of the
whole hierarchy, and all the legitimate
possessions of his church. But he came
not in peace, nor was he received in
<span class="locked">peace.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Becket prepares for his return.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> It was not the Archbishop
of Rouen, as he had
hoped, but his old enemy John of Oxford,
who was commanded by the King
to accompany him, and reinstate him
in his see. The King might allege that
one so much in the royal confidence
was the best protector of the Archbishop.
The money which had been
promised for his voyage was not paid;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
he was forced to borrow £300 of the
Archbishop of Rouen. He went, as he
felt, or affected to feel, with death before
his eyes, yet nothing should now
separate him from his long-divided flock.
Before his embarkation at Whitsand
in Flanders, he received intelligence
that the shores were watched by his
enemies, it was said with designs on his
<span class="locked">life,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> but assuredly with the determination
of making a rigid search for the
letters of <span class="locked">excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Letters of excommunication sent before him.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> To secure
the safe carriage of one of these
perilous documents, the suspension
of the Archbishop of York,
it was intrusted to a nun named Idonea,
whom he exhorts, like another Judith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
to this holy act, and promises her as
her reward the remission of her <span class="locked">sins.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span>
Other contraband letters were conveyed
across the Channel by unknown hands,
and were delivered to the bishops before
Becket's landing.</p>

<p>The prelates of York and London
were at Canterbury when they received
these Papal letters. When the fulminating
instruments were read before
them, in which was this passage, "we
will fill your faces with ignominy,"
their countenances fell. They sent messengers
to complain to Becket, that he
came not in peace, but in fire and flame,
trampling his brother bishops under his

that he had condemned them uncited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
unheard, unjudged. "There is
no peace," Becket sternly replied, "but
to men of good <span class="locked">will."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span> It was said that
London was disposed to humble himself
before Becket; but <span class="locked">York,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span> trusting in
his wealth, boasted that he had in his
power the Pope, the King, and all their
courts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lands at
Sandwich. <span class="locked">Dec. 1.</span></div>

<p>Instead of the port of Dover, where
he was expected, Becket's vessel, with
the archiepiscopal banner displayed,
cast anchor at Sandwich.
Soon after his landing, appeared
in arms the Sheriff of Kent, Randulph
de Broc, and others of his enemies.
They searched his baggage, fiercely demanded
that he should absolve the
bishops, and endeavored to force the
Archdeacon of Sens, a foreign ecclesiastic,
to take an oath to keep the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of the realm. John of Oxford was
shocked, and repressed their violence.
On his way to Canterbury the country
clergy came forth with their flocks to
meet him; they strewed their garments
in his way, chanting, "Blessed is he
that cometh in the name of the Lord."
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>At Canterbury.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Arrived at Canterbury, he rode at
once to the church with a vast
procession of clergy, amid the ringing
of the bells, and the chanting of music.
He took his archiepiscopal throne, and
afterwards preached on the text, "Here
we have no abiding city." The next
morning came again the Sheriff of Kent,
with Randulph de Broc, and the messengers
of the bishops, demanding their
<span class="locked">absolution.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> Becket evaded the question
by asserting that the Excommunication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was not pronounced by him, but
by his superior the Pope; that he had
no power to abrogate the sentence.
This declaration was directly at issue
with the bull of excommunication: if
the bishops gave satisfaction to the
Archbishop, he had power to act on
behalf of the <span class="locked">Pope.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> But to the satisfaction
which, according to one account,
he did demand, that they should stand
a public trial, in other words place
themselves at his mercy, they would
not, and hardly could submit. They
set out immediately to the King in
Normandy.</p>

<p>The restless Primate was determined
to keep alive the popular fervor, enthusiastically,
almost fanatically, on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
side. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Goes to London.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> On a pretext of a visit to
the young King at Woodstock,
to offer him the present of three beautiful
horses, he set forth on a stately
progress. Wherever he went he was
received with acclamations and prayers
for his blessings by the clergy and the
people. In Rochester he was entertained
by the Bishop with great ceremony.
In London there was the same
excitement: he was received in the
palace by the Bishop of Winchester in
Southwark. Even there he scattered
some <span class="locked">excommunications.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span> The Court
took alarm, and sent orders to the prelate
to return to his diocese. Becket
obeyed, but alleged as the cause of his
obedience, not the royal command, but
his own desire to celebrate the festival
of Christmas in his metropolitan church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
The week passed in holding sittings in
his court, where he acted with his usual
promptitude, vigor, and resolution
against the intruders into livings, and
upon the encroachments on his estates;
and in devotions most fervent, mortifications
most <span class="locked">austere.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span></p>

<p>His rude enemies committed in the
mean time all kinds of petty annoyances,
which he had not the loftiness
to disdain. Randulph de Broc seized a
vessel laden with rich wine for his use,
and imprisoned the sailors in Pevensey
Castle. An order from the court compelled
him to release ship and crew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
They robbed the people who carried his
provisions, broke into his park, hunted
his deer, beat his retainers; and, at the
instigation of Randulph's brother, Robert
de Broc, a ruffian, a renegade monk,
cut off the tail of one of his state horses.</p>

<p>On Christmas day Becket preached
on the appropriate text, "Peace on
earth, good will towards men." The
sermon agreed ill with the text. He
spoke of one of his predecessors, St. Alphege,
who had suffered martyrdom.
"There may soon be a second." He
then burst out into a fierce, impetuous,
terrible tone, arraigned the courtiers,
and closed with a fulminating excommunication
against Nigel de Sackville,
who had refused to give up a benefice
into which, in Becket's judgment, he
had intruded, and against Randulph
and Robert de Broc. The maimed
horse was not forgotten. He renewed
in the most vehement language the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
censure on the bishops, dashed the candle
on the pavement in token of their
utter extinction, and then proceeded to
the mass at the <span class="locked">altar.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishops
with the
King.</div>

<p>In the mean time the excommunicated
prelates had sought the King
in the neighborhood of Bayeux;
they implored his protection for themselves
and the clergy of the realm. "If
all are to be visited by spiritual censures,"
said the King, "who officiated
at the coronation of my son, by the eyes
of God, I am equally guilty." The whole
conduct of Becket since his return was
detailed, and no doubt deeply darkened
by the hostility of his adversaries. All
had been done with an insolent and seditious
design of alienating the affections
of the people from the King.
Henry demanded counsel of the prelates;
they declared themselves unable
to give it. But one incautiously said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
"So long as Thomas lives, you will
never be at peace." The King broke
out into one of his terrible constitutional
fits of passion; and at length let fall the
fatal words, "Have I none of my thankless
and cowardly courtiers who will
relieve me from the insults of one low-born
and turbulent priest?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King's
fatal words.</div>

<p>These words were not likely to fall
unheard on the ears of fierce,
and warlike men, reckless of
bloodshed, possessed with a strong sense
of their feudal allegiance, and eager to
secure to themselves the reward of desperate
service. Four knights, chamberlains
of the King, Reginald Fitz-Urse,
William de Tracy, Hugh de Moreville,
and Reginald Brito, disappeared from
the <span class="locked">court.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span> On the morrow, when a
grave council was held, some barons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
are said, even there, to have advised
the death of Becket. Milder measures
were adopted: the Earl of Mandeville
was sent off with orders to arrest the
Primate; and as the disappearance of
these four knights could not be unmarked,
to stop them in the course of any
unauthorized enterprise.</p>

<p>But murder travels faster than justice
or mercy. They were almost already
on the shores of England. It is said
that they met in Saltwood Castle. On
the 28th of December, having, by the
aid of Randulph de Broc, collected
some troops in the streets of Canterbury,
they took up their quarters with
Clarembold, Abbot of St. Augustine's.</p>

<p>The assassination of Becket has something
appalling, with all its terrible
circumstances seen in the remote past.
What was it in its own age? The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
distinguished churchman in Christendom,
the champion of the great sacerdotal
order, almost in the hour of his
triumph over the most powerful king
in Europe; a man, besides the awful
sanctity inherent in the person of every
ecclesiastic, of most saintly holiness;
soon after the most solemn festival of
the Church, in his own cathedral, not
only sacrilegiously, but cruelly murdered,
with every mark of hatred and
insult. Becket had all the dauntlessness,
none of the meekness of the
martyr; but while his dauntlessness
would command boundless admiration,
few, if any, would seek the
more genuine sign of Christian martyrdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The knights
before
Becket.</div>

<p>The four knights do not seem to have
deliberately determined on their
proceedings, or to have resolved,
except in extremity, on the murder. They
entered, but unarmed, the outer <span class="locked">chamber.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
The Archbishop had just dined,
and withdrawn from the hall. They
were offered food, as was the usage;
they declined, thirsting, says one of the
biographers, for blood. The Archbishop
obeyed the summons to hear a message
from the King; they were admitted to
his presence. As they entered, there
was no salutation on either side, till the
Primate having surveyed, perhaps recognized
them, moved to them with
cold courtesy. Fitz-Urse was the spokesman
in the fierce altercation which ensued.
Becket replied with haughty
firmness. Fitz-Urse began by reproaching
him with his ingratitude and seditious
disloyalty in opposing the coronation
of the King's son, and commanded
him, in instant obedience to the
King, to absolve the prelates. Becket
protested that so far from wishing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
diminish the power of the King's son,
he would have given him three crowns
and the most splendid realm. For the
excommunicated bishops he persisted
in his usual evasion that they had been
suspended by the Pope, by the Pope
alone could they be absolved; nor had
they yet offered proper satisfaction.
"It is the King's command," spake
Fitz-Urse, "that you and the rest of
your disloyal followers leave the <span class="locked">kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span>
"It becomes not the King to
utter such command: henceforth no
power on earth shall separate me from
my flock." "You have presumed to
excommunicate, without consulting the
King, the King's servant's and officers."
"Nor will I ever spare the man who
violates the canons of Rome, or the
rights of the Church." "From whom
do you hold your archbishopric?"
"My spirituals from God and the Pope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
my temporals from the King." "Do
you not hold all from the King?"
"Render unto Cæsar the things that
are Cæsar's, and unto God the things
that are God's." "You speak in peril
of your life!" "Come ye to murder
me? I defy you, and will meet you
front to front in the battle of the Lord."
He added, that some among them had
sworn fealty to him. At this, it is said,
they grew furious, and gnashed with
their teeth. The prudent John of Salisbury
heard with regret this intemperate
language: "Would it may end well!"
Fitz-Urse shouted aloud, "In the King's
name I enjoin you all, clerks and monks,
to arrest this man, till the King shall
have done justice on his body." They
rushed out, calling for their arms.</p>

<p>His friends had more fear for Becket
than Becket for himself. The gates
were closed and barred, but presently
sounds were heard of those without,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
striving to break in. The lawless Randulph
de Broc was hewing at the door
with an axe. All around Becket was
the confusion of terror: he only was
calm. Again spoke John of Salisbury
with his cold prudence&mdash;"Thou wilt
never take counsel: they seek thy life."
"I am prepared to die." "We who
are sinners are not so weary of life."
"God's will be done." The sounds
without grew wilder. All around him
entreated Becket to seek sanctuary in
the church. He refused, whether from
religious reluctance that the holy place
should be stained with his blood, or
from the nobler motive of sparing his
assassins this deep aggravation of their
crime. They urged that the bell was
already tolling for vespers. He seemed
to give a reluctant consent; but he
would not move without the dignity of
his crosier carried before him.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Becket in the Church.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> With gentle compulsion they half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
drew, half carried him through a private
chamber, they in all the hasty agony
of terror, he striving to maintain his
solemn state, into the church. The din
of the armed men was ringing in the
cloister. The affrighted monks broke
off the service; some hastened to close
the doors; Becket commanded them to
desist&mdash;"No one should be debarred
from entering the house of God." John
of Salisbury and the rest fled and hid
themselves behind the altars and in
other dark places. The Archbishop
might have escaped into the dark and
intricate crypt, or into a chapel in the
roof. There remained only the Canon
Robert (of Merton), Fitz-Stephen, and
the faithful Edward Grim. Becket
stood between the altar of St. Benedict
and that of the <span class="locked">Virgin.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span> It was thought
that Becket contemplated taking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
seat on his archiepiscopal throne near
the high altar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The murder.</div>

<p>Through the open door of the cloister
came rushing in the four, fully
armed, some with axes in their hands,
with two or three wild followers, through
the dim and bewildering twilight. The
knights shouted aloud, "Where is the
traitor?"&mdash;No answer came back.&mdash;"Where
is the Archbishop?" "Behold
me, no traitor, but a priest of God!"
Another fierce and rapid altercation
followed: they demanded the absolution
of the bishops, his own surrender to
the King's justice. They strove to seize
him and to drag him forth from the
church (even they had awe of the holy
place), either to kill him without, or to
carry him in bonds to the King. He
clung to the pillar. In the struggle he
grappled with De Tracy, and with desperate
strength dashed him on the pavement.
His passion rose; he called Fitz-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>Urse
by a foul name, a pander. These
were almost his last words (how unlike
those of Stephen and the greater than
Stephen!) He taunted Fitz-Urse with
his fealty sworn to himself. "I owe no
fealty but to my King!" returned the
maddened soldier, and struck the first
blow. Edward Grim interposed his
arm, which was almost severed off.
The sword struck Becket, but slightly,
on the head. Becket received it in an
attitude of prayer&mdash;"Lord, receive my
spirit," with an ejaculation to the Saints
of the Church. Blow followed blow
(Tracy seems to have dealt the first
mortal wound), till all, unless perhaps
De Moreville, had wreaked their vengeance.
The last, that of Richard de
Brito, smote off a piece of his skull.
Hugh of Horsea, their follower, a renegade
priest surnamed Mauclerk, set his
heel upon his neck, and crushed out
the blood and brains. "Away!" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the brutal ruffian, "it is time that we
were gone." They rushed out to plunder
the archiepiscopal palace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Body.</div>

<p>The mangled body was left on the
pavement; and when his affrighted
followers ventured to approach
to perform their last offices, an incident
occurred which, however incongruous,
is too characteristic to be suppressed.
Amid their adoring awe at his courage
and constancy, their profound sorrow
for his loss, they broke out into a rapture
of wonder and delight on discovering
not merely that his whole body was
swathed in the coarsest sackcloth, but
that his lower garments were swarming
with vermin. From that moment miracles
began. Even the populace had
before been divided; voices had been
heard among the crowd denying him to
be a martyr; he was but the victim of
his own <span class="locked">obstinacy.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> The Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of York even after this dared to preach
that it was a judgment of God against
Becket&mdash;that "he perished, like Pharaoh,
in his <span class="locked">pride."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span> But the torrent
swept away at once all this resistance.
The Government inhibited the miracles,
but faith in miracles scorns obedience
to human laws. The Passion of the
Martyr Thomas was saddened and glorified
every day with new incidents of
its atrocity, of his holy firmness, of
wonders wrought by his remains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
the murder.</div>

<p>The horror of Becket's murder ran
throughout Christendom. At first, of
course, it was attributed to Henry's
direct orders. Universal hatred
branded the King of England
with a kind of outlawry, a spontaneous
excommunication. William of Sens,
though the attached friend of Becket,
probably does not exaggerate the public
sentiment when he describes this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
deed as surpassing the cruelty of Herod,
the perfidy of Julian, the sacrilege of
the traitor <span class="locked">Judas.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span></p>

<p>It were injustice to King Henry not
to suppose that with the dread as to
the consequences of this act must have
mingled some reminiscences of the gallant
friend and companion of his youth
and of the faithful minister, as well as
religious horror at a cruel murder, so
savagely and impiously <span class="locked">executed.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span> He
shut himself for three days in his chamber,
obstinately refused all food and
comfort, till his attendants began to fear
for his life. He issued orders for the
apprehension of the <span class="locked">murderers,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
dispatched envoys to the Pope to exculpate
himself from all participation
or cognizance of the crime. His ambassadors
found the Pope at Tusculum:
they were at first sternly refused an
audience. The afflicted and indignant
Pope was hardly prevailed on to permit
the execrated name of the King of England
to be uttered before him. The
cardinals still friendly to the King with
difficulty obtained knowledge of Alexander's
determination. It was, on a
fixed day, to pronounce with the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
solemnity, excommunication against the
King by name, and an interdict on all
his dominions, on the Continent as well
as in England. The ambassadors hardly
obtained the abandonment of this
fearful purpose, by swearing that the
King would submit in all things to the
judgment of his Holiness. With difficulty
the terms of reconciliation were
arranged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reconciliation
at
Avranches.</div>

<p>In the Cathedral of Avranches in Normandy,
in the presence of the
Cardinals Theodin of Porto, and
Albert the Chancellor, Legates for that
especial purpose, Henry swore on the
Gospels that he had neither commanded
nor desired the death of Becket; that
it had caused him sorrow, not joy; he
had not grieved so deeply for the death
of his father or his <span class="locked">mother.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> He stipulated&mdash;I.
To maintain two hundred knights
at his own cost in the Holy Land. II.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
To abrogate the Statutes of Clarendon,
and all bad customs introduced during
his <span class="locked">reign.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span> III. That he would reinvest
the Church of Canterbury in all its
rights and possessions, and pardon and
restore to their estates all who had incurred
his wrath in the cause of the
Primate. IV. If the Pope should require
it, he would himself make a crusade
against the Saracens in
Spain. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Ascension Day, May 22, 1172.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> In the porch of the
church he was reconciled, but with no
ignominous ceremony.</p>

<p>Throughout the later and the darker
part of Henry's reign the clergy took
care to inculcate, and the people were
prone enough to believe, that all his
disasters and calamities, the rebellion
of his wife and of his sons, were judgments
of God for the persecution if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the murder of the Martyr Thomas. The
strong mind of Henry himself, depressed
by misfortune and by the estrangement
of his children, acknowledged
with superstitious awe the justice of
their conclusions. Heaven, the Martyr
in Heaven, must be appeased by a public
humiliating penance. The deeper
the degradation the more valuable the
atonement. In less than three years
after his death the King visited the
tomb of Becket, by this time a canonized
saint, renowned not only throughout
England for his wonder-working
powers, but to the limits of Christendom.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Penance at Canterbury. Friday, July 12, 1174.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> As soon as he came near enough
to see the towers of Canterbury,
the King dismounted from his
horse, and for three miles
walked with bare and bleeding feet
along the flinty road. The tomb of the
Saint was then in the crypt beneath
the church. The King threw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
prostrate before it. The Bishop of London
(Foliot) preached; he declared to
the wondering multitude that on his
solemn oath the King was entirely guiltless
of the murder of the Saint: but as
his hasty words had been the innocent
cause of the crime, he submitted in
lowly obedience to the penance of the
Church. The haughty monarch then
prayed to be scourged by the willing
monks. From the one end of the church
to the other each ecclesiastic present
gratified his pride, and thought that he
performed his duty, by giving a few
<span class="locked">stripes.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> The King passed calmly
through this rude discipline, and then
spent a night and a day in prayers and
tears, imploring the intercession in
Heaven of him whom, he thought not
now on how just grounds, he had pursued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
with relentless animosity on
<span class="locked">earth.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Becket obtained by his death
that triumph for which he would perhaps
have struggled in vain through a
long life. He was now a Saint, and for
some centuries the most popular Saint
in England: among the people, from a
generous indignation at his barbarous
murder, from the fame of his austerities
and his charities, no doubt from admiration
of his bold resistance to the kingly
power; among the clergy as the
champion, the martyr of their order.
Even if the clergy had had no interest
in the miracles at the tomb of Becket,
the high-strung faith of the people
would have wrought them almost without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
suggestion or assistance. Cures
would have been made or imagined;
the latent powers of diseased or paralyzed
bodies would have been quickened
into action. Belief, and the fear of
disbelieving, would have multiplied
one extraordinary event into a hundred;
fraud would be outbid by zeal; the invention
of the crafty, even if what may
seem invention was not more often ignorance
and credulity, would be outrun
by the demands of superstition. There
is no calculating the extent and effects
of these epidemic outbursts of passionate
<span class="locked">religion.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket
martyr of
the clergy.</div>

<p>Becket was indeed the martyr of the
clergy, not of the Church; of sacerdotal
power, not of Christianity;
of a caste, not of <span class="locked">mankind.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
From beginning to end it was a strife
for the authority, the immunities, the
possessions of the <span class="locked">clergy.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span> The liberty
of the Church was the exemption of the
clergy from law; the vindication of
their separate, exclusive, distinctive
existence from the rest of mankind. It
was a sacrifice to the deified self; not
the individual self, but self as the centre
and representative of a great corporation.
Here and there in the long full
correspondence there is some slight allusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to the miseries of the people in being
deprived of the services of the exiled

the confiscated property is said to be a

temporal sovereign to Rome, and the
asserted superiority of the spiritual
rulers in every respect over the temporal
power. There might, indeed, be
latent advantages to mankind, social,
moral, and religious, in this secluded
sanctity of one class of men; it might
be well that there should be a barrier
against the fierce and ruffian violence
of kings and barons; that somewhere
freedom should find a voice, and some
protest be made against the despotism
of arms, especially in a newly-conquered
country like England, where the kingly
and aristocratic power was still foreign:
above all, that there should be a caste,
not an hereditary one, into which ability
might force its way up, from the most
low-born, even from the servile rank;
but the liberties of the Church, as they
were called, were but the establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of one tyranny&mdash;a milder, perhaps, but
not less rapacious tyranny&mdash;instead of
another; a tyranny which aspired to
uncontrolled, irresponsible rule, nor
was above the inevitable evil produced
on rulers as well as on subjects, from
the consciousness of arbitrary and autocratic
power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Verdict of
posterity.</div>

<p>Reflective posterity may perhaps consider
as not the least remarkable
point in this lofty and tragic
strife that it was but a strife for power.
Henry II. was a sovereign who, with
many noble and kingly qualities, lived,
more than even most monarchs of his
age, in direct violation of every Christian
precept of justice, humanity, conjugal
fidelity. He was lustful, cruel,
treacherous, arbitrary. But throughout
this contest there is no remonstrance
whatever from Primate or Pope against
his disobedience to the laws of God,
only to those of the Church. Becket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<i class="emphasis">might</i>, indeed, if he had retained his
full and acknowledged religious power,
have rebuked the vices, protected the
subjects, interceded for the victims of
the King's unbridled passions. It must
be acknowledged by all that he did not
take the wisest course to secure this
which might have been beneficent influence.
But as to what appears, if the
King would have consented to allow
the churchmen to despise all law&mdash;if
he had not insisted on hanging priests
guilty of homicide as freely as laymen&mdash;he
might have gone on unreproved
in his career of ambition; he might unrebuked
have seduced or ravished the
wives and daughters of his nobles; extorted,
without remonstrance of the
Clergy any revenue from his subjects,
if he had kept his hands from the
treasures of the Church. Henry's real
tyranny was not (would it in any case
have been?) the object of the churchman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
censure, oppugnancy, or resistance.
The cruel and ambitious and
rapacious King would doubtless have
lived unexcommunicated and died with
plenary absolution.</p>

besides fragments, legends, and "Passions."
Dr. Giles has reprinted, and in some respects
enlarged, those works from the authority of MSS.
I give them in the order of his volumes. I.
Vita Sancti Thomæ. Auctore Edward Grim.
II. Auctore Roger de Pontiniaco. III. Auctore
Willelmo Filio Stephani. IV. Auctoribus Joanne
Decano Salisburiensi, et Alano Abbate
Teuksburiensi. V. Auctore Willelmo Canterburiensi.
VI. Auctore Anonymo Lambethiensi.
VII. Auctore Herberto de Bosham. Of
these, Grim, Fitz-Stephen, and Herbert de Bosham
were throughout his life in more or less
close attendance on Becket. The learned John
of Salisbury was his bosom friend and counsellor.
Roger of Pontigny was his intimate associate
and friend in that monastery. William
was probably prior of Canterbury at the time
of Becket's death. The sixth professes also to
have been witness to the death of Becket. (He
is called Lambethiensis by Dr. Giles, merely
because the MS. is in the Lambeth Library.)
Add to these the curious French poem, written
five years after the murder of Becket, by Garnier
of Pont S. Maxence, partly published in the
Berlin Transactions, by the learned Immanuel
Bekker. All these, it must be remembered,
write of the man; the later monkish writers
(though near the time, Hoveden, Gervase, Diceto,
Brompton) of the Saint.</p></div>

Dr. Lingard observes that Mr. Berington has
proved this letter to be spurious. I cannot see
any force in Mr. Berington's arguments, and
should certainly have paid more deference to
Dr. Lingard himself if he had examined the
question. It seems, moreover (if I rightly
understand Dr. Giles, and I am not certain that
I do), that it exists in more than one MS. of
Foliot's letters. He has printed it as unquestioned;
no very satisfactory proceeding in an
editor. The conclusive argument for its authenticity
with me is this: Who, after Becket's
death and canonization, would have ventured
or thought it worth while to forge such a letter?
To whom was Foliot's memory so dear,
or Becket's so hateful, as to reopen the whole
strife about his election and his conduct? Besides,
it seems clear that it is either a rejoinder
to the long letter addressed by Becket to the
clergy of England (Giles, iii. 170), or that letter
is a rejoinder to Foliot's. Each is a violent
party pamphlet against the other, and of great

Bouquet, xvi. 210, to judge of the skillful steering
and difficulties of the Pope. There is a
very curious letter of an emissary of Becket,
describing the death of the Antipope (he died
at Lucca, April 21). The canons of San Frediano,
in Lucca, refused to bury him, because he
was already "buried in hell." The writer announces
that the Emperor also was ill, that the
Empress had miscarried, and that therefore
all France adhered with greater devotion to
Alexander; <i class="emphasis">and the Legatine commission to
the Archbishop of York had expired without hope
of recovery</i>. The writer ventures, however, to
suggest to Becket to conduct himself with
modesty; to seek rather than avoid intercourse
with the king.&mdash;Apud Giles, iv. 240; Bouquet,

Joscelin, Bishop of Salisbury, notwithstanding
the papal prohibition that no election
should take place in the absence of some of the
canons, chose the safer course of obedience to
the King's mandate. This act of Joscelin was
deeply resented by Becket. John of Oxford's
usurpation of the deanery was one of the causes
assigned for his excommunication at Vezelay.
See also, on the loyal but somewhat unscrupulous
proceedings of John of Oxford, the letter
(hereafter referred to) of Nicholas de Monte
Rotomagensi. It describes the attempt of John
of Oxford to prepossess the Empress Matilda
against Becket. It likewise betrays again the
double-dealing of the Bishop of Lisieux, outwardly
for the King, secretly a partisan and
adviser of Becket. On the whole, it shows the
moderation and good sense of the empress, who
disapproved of some of the Constitutions, and
especially of their being written, but speaks
strongly of the abuses in the Church. Nicholas
admires her skillfulness in defending her son.&mdash;Giles,

by Hugh of Poitiers (translated in Guizot,
Collection des Mémoires), though it twice mentions
Becket, stops just short of this excommunication,
1166. Vezelay boasted to be subject
only to the See of Rome, to have been made by
its founder part of the patrimony of St. Peter.
This was one great distinction: the other was
the unquestioned possession of the body of St.
Mary Magdalene, "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l'amie de Dieu</span>." Vezelay
had been in constant strife with the Bishop of
Autun for its ecclesiastical, with the Count of
Nevers for its territorial, independence; with
the monastery of Clugny, as its rival. This is
a document very instructive as to the life of the

sujets qui ont un sens, quel était l'esprit du
temps et la manière d'interpréter la religion.
Ce n'était pas par la douceur ou la persuasion
qu'on voulait convertir, mais bien par la terreur.
Les discours des prêtres pourraient se résumer
en ce peu de mots: 'Croyez, ou sinon vous périssez
misérablement, et vous serez éternellement
tourmentés dans l'autre monde!' De leur côté
les artistes, gens religieux, ecclésiastiques même
pour la plupart, donnaient une forme réelle aux
sombres images que leur inspirait un zèle farouche.
Je ne trouve à Vezelay aucun de ces
sujets que les ames tendres aimeraient à retracer,
tels que le pardon accordé au repentir, la récompense
du juste, &amp;c.; mais au contraire, je
vois Samuel égorgeant Agag; des diables écartelant
des damnés, ou les entraînant dans l'abîme;
puis des animaux horribles, des monstres hideux,
des têtes grimaçantes exprimant ou les souffrances
des reprouvés, ou la joie des habitans de l'enfer.
Qu'on se représente la dévotion des hommes
élevés au milieu de ces images, et l'on s'étonnera
moins des massacres des Albigeois.</span>"&mdash;Notes d'un

upon in a letter of Peter of Blois to John of

Lord Lyttelton, and which he admits was produced,
to have been a forgery. If it was, it
was a most audacious one; and a most flagrant
insult to the Pope, whom Henry was even now
endeavoring to propitiate through the Lombard
Republics and the Emperor of the East (see
Giles, iv. 10). It is remarkable, too, that
though the Pope declares that this coronation,
contrary to his prohibition (Giles, iv. 30), is not
to be taken as a precedent, he has no word of
the forgery. Nor do I find any contemporary
assertion of its spuriousness. Becket, indeed,
in his account of the last interview with the
King, only mentions the general permission
granted by the Pope at an early period of the
reign; and argues as if this were the only permission.
Is it possible that a special permission
to York to act was craftily interpolated
into the general permission? But the trick may
have been on the side of the Pope, now granting,
now nullifying his own grants by inhibition.
Bouquet is strong against Baronius (as on other

tracing out the extraordinary fate of the murderers.
"By a singular reciprocity, the principle
for which Becket had contended, that priests
should not be subjected to the secular courts,
prevented the trial of a layman for the murder
of a priest by any other than a clerical tribunal."
Legend imposes upon them dark and romantic
acts of penance; history finds them in high
places of trust and honor.&mdash;pp. 377, <i class="abbreviation" xml:lang="la" lang="la">et seqq.</i> I
may add that John of Oxford five years after
was Bishop of Norwich. Ridel too became

crimes of individual men, but there is one case,
mentioned by no less an authority than John
of Salisbury, too flagrant to pass over: it was
in Becket's own cathedral city. Immediately
after Becket's death the Bishops of Exeter and
Worcester were commissioned by Pope Alexander
to visit St. Augustine's, Canterbury.
They report the total dilapidation of the buildings
and estates. The prior elect "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Jugi, quod
